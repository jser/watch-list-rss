.normalui-logo-cls-1{fill:#ffffff;}Normal UI: A Usability Technique For Non-DesignersI&#39;ve been building web apps for 25 years. B2B, SaaS, eCommerce, intranet apps, and more. I&#39;ve also been a UX designer for much of that time. I&#39;ve run and watched hundreds, if not thousands, of usability tests.That means I&#39;ve been watching average users (non-developers) try to use web apps (without helping them) for over two decades.You begin to see patterns in what makes a web app usable or unusuable under particular circumstances.In this post I will introduce you to a technique that I developed over those years. It provides a simple, concrete framework to improve web app usability, is friendly to non-designers, often results in cleaner code and improved accessibility, and facilitates good UX and developer communication.I call it &quot;Normal UI&quot;.(If you&#39;d like to watch a video version of this post, I&#39;m embedding it below.)The Design DilemmaThere are two versions of a dilemma in web app design that I see de

Smart jerks aren&#39;t worth it. Let&#39;s dispel the myth.The Myth of the Difficult GeniusThe myth of the &quot;difficult genius&quot; is not unique to software development. The myth itself proliferates in part because of famously difficult-to-deal-with scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and more throughout history.A steady diet of books, movies, and pop culture have taught us that great things are accomplished by jerks and the people who tolerate them. This has been true.It is also true that great things have been accomplished by well-functioning cohesive teams of people who respected each other.

Understanding React CompilerReact&#39;s core architecture calls the functions you give it (i.e. your components) over and over. This fact both contributed to its popularity by simplifying its mental model, and created a point of possible performance issues. In general, if your functions do expensive things, then your app will be slow.Performance tuning, therefore, became a pain point for devs, as they had to manually tell React which functions should be re-run and when. The React team has now provided a tool called the React Compiler to automate that manual work performance tuning for devs, by rewriting their code.What does React Compiler do to your code? How does it work under-the-hood? Should you use it? Let&#39;s dive in.To gain a complete, accurate mental model of React by deep diving into its internals, check out my new course Understanding React where we dig into React&#39;s source code.

On The Why DownHow To Do Better Than MVPHow do we build software that solves real problems? How do both software development teams and the organizations that surround and utilize them come together to make good decisions? How do we acknowledge and work with the human factors built into all aspects of software development? How do we know what to build?The Myth of the MVPThe &quot;Minimum Viable Product&quot; is a great idea on paper. Over the years, however, I find that, no matter the software development process, defining what needs to be built is a problem that it doesn&#39;t solve well.MVP has two major flaws:The fog of &quot;viability&quot;: Who decides what is &quot;viable&quot;? This term is subjective, and highly susceptible to organizational politics and human bias.The undefined &quot;minimum&quot;: Minimum is a moving target, and often incorrect. It&#39;s susceptible to siloed organizational structures and communication breakdowns.MVP isn&#39;t the only issue. Companies have adopted Scrum and Agile. These too are meant to approa

Boarding a Southwest Airlines plane is a study in frustration. There are always at least several people milling about in confusion, most trying to figure out their line-up process while handling bags and children.The competitive ‘get on the plane first and claim a seat before everyone else’ turns their confused state into potentials for agitation and aggression (getting ahead of others when you shouldn’t, realizing too late you’re further back than you should have been).Those who are frequent flyers on the airline have a decided advantage over the new ones, and the agitated state of passengers translate into more frazzled employees.UX isn’t just about ease of use. It’s about avoiding frustration. It’s about how software makes you feel.Frustrating software results in agitated users. Agitated users means you have failed UX. Agitated users also introduces a host of other problems, such as exaggerated complaints, lack of patience with other minor software issues, and loss of loyalty.Care a

However certain functions, especially dangerous ones, should not be made easy to accidentally invoke.For deletions, take a user to a completely separate screen or large modal with clear indications of what is about to happen.Wherever possible and applicable, provide ‘undo’, and make it immediately available after the action is taken.Easy-to-use is rewarding.

Key and LockIn his seminal work The Design of Everyday Things (revised in 2013), Don Norman notes that with every new technology designers repeat the same mistakes of the past.User experience designers should not fall into this trap, because a fundamental key to good UX design is humility. It takes humility to change a design based on user testing; and it takes humility to look back at technologies of the past that have endured, and show them their due respect.One of the oldest and best interfaces has endured for thousands of years. The two part interface: key and lock. Let&#39;s pull some software lessons from before there was software.GuessabilityThe key and lock is guessable. Most doors have only one keyhole. The key looks like it fits in the hole. If you handed someone a key, and pointed them at its corresponding door, they would likely guess what to do even if they&#39;d never done it before.Both the key and lock follow DOTW (Do One Thing Well) and it is hard for a user to get it wrong.Ma

The key and lock is one of the oldest and best examples of a good interface. It’s guessable (there’s only one keyhole in the average door), secure (you have to know and have the right key, but it isn’t hard to use), consistent (know how to use one key, you know how to use almost all), and provides good feedback (key turns or it doesn’t).Above the all the key/lock interface is good abstraction. Few people truly know how the tumblers in a lock work, and fewer still could design them. Yet the key abstracts the user away from the inner workings of the lock, allowing them to focus on the task (opening or locking the door) rather than how the tool helps them accomplish it.Interfaces that have been around for centuries have done so for a reason, because they rely on UX truths that work no matter what the technology.Guessability, security, consistency, feedback, and good abstractions are something that every interface (physical, software, or otherwise) should share.</div><div

Drink machine at a local Five Guys. I watched as every single person made some form of mistake during use.There is a touch screen selection UI, and a ‘Push’ button below it. However the button always says &#39;Push’, so most push it not realizing they’ve made a mistake in the selection process and something unexpected pours out.The beauty of old-school drink machines is that they’re hard to get wrong. Each lever corresponds to a specific drink, and the only action available per drink is &#39;make this drink come out’.Newer or prettier isn’t always better. Using a new interface technology simply for the sake of the new technology is a fail if you don’t follow the basics of good user experience.In this case the UX principle broken is feedback. Since one button does many things (&#39;Push’ could mean one of any of the drinks), it fails to follow DOTW, thus good feedback is vital.For example the button could say &#39;Push for Coke’ when Coke is selected and &#39;Push for Sprite’ when Sprite is selected, etc.

A Behringer 802 Mixer. Mixer boards are powerful and useful, but they must be learned. A mixer board is the opposite of a lightswitch, there is nothing obvious or intuitive about it.There are so many options the user’s best guess is likely wrong (though labeling helps), and the designer must rely on memorization and education on the user’s part to use the device well.There is nothing wrong with dashboards, portals, hubs, etc - as long as you don’t expect them to be used by new users. Many options means many ways to get it wrong.

DOTW: Do One Thing WellThe Mantra of the Guessable InterfaceIn the land of coding there is a principle that defines the essence of modern multi-tier software architectures. DRY: Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself.DRY has become so widely accepted in software design because the benefits are obvious and immediate. Less code to write, less bugs to fix. It makes for less confusing software from the programmer&#39;s perspective, which leads to better software for everyone.The DRY principle is this: &quot;Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.&quot; DRY works for software architecture. It&#39;s about reduction.In my design experience I have found that there is a very similar UX principle that is equally effective in developing usable (that is, guessable) software.DOTW: Do One Thing WellThe principle is simple. As with all principles, its application varies depending on the circumstances. If I was to try defining DOTW more strictly, I would say:Any screen or

A mechanical pencil follows DOTW (Do One Thing Well). There is only one way to get lead out, and only one option to try. However it breaks down when the lead runs out. How many times have you shaken a pencil to see if lead is still in it?Better: If, once the lead ran out, a bright red warning piece of plastic came out of the tip clearly indicating the error state.A simple interface that ‘Does One Thing Well’ is highly desirable and guessable. Yet you must take into account all 3 states of an interface: Empty, Full, and Error.If you have a clear picture of all three states when you design then so will your users.</div><div class="ui-feed-item__date" title="2014-01-09 00:00:00">11年前</div></div></div><div class="ui-feed-item"><a class="ui-feed-item__og-image" href="https://tonyalicea.dev/projects/good-interface-bad-interface/entries/12/"><img src="../../images/alternate-feed-image.png" loading="lazy" alt="記事のアイキャッチ画像" width="256" height="256"></a><div class="ui-feed-item__content"><a

Back of a Black &amp; Decker Air Station. Can be powered from a standard plug (AC) or a car lighter (DC), and you choose which. The design doesn’t assume you know which is AC and which is DC.Actually, it gives various opportunities to figure out which is which, and when all else fails provides the icon of a car to make it absolutely clear. It’s ensuring understanding and educating at the same time.Labels are good. Labels that assume the user has a specialized vocabulary are not. For example a button that says ‘Check If This Username is Available’ is much better than a button that says &#39;Validate The Uniqueness of this ID’.Be sure your labels do not make unreasonable vocabulary assumptions.

Good Interface, Bad InterfaceI have been doing a great deal of traveling as of late. Travel is frustrating. Airports, hotels, car rides and more are filled with other people&#39;s design choices. Some are good, some are bad, and they all carry lessons in user experience.Airport bathrooms, for example, turn out to be pretty diverse in their design choices - and their influence on the traveler&#39;s overall user experience is, understandably, intense. When it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s really bad.So, when faced with a bad user experience, I apply a simple mantra:If you see every moment as an opportunity to either teach or learn, life is a lot more enjoyable.Actually I try to apply this for good user experiences as well. Try to stop and recognize it when you&#39;ve just effortlessly used some device or process, and ask yourself why it worked so well. Then take that lesson and ask how does it apply to software.Every user experience you have, whether bad or good, can inform the software you design.I&#39;ll give you an ex
