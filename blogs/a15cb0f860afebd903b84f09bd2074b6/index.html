Take a look at the recent updates – and a big thank you to our amazing team for putting so much love into SpeedCurve!Start simple, go deep...Performance is hard, complex, and riddled with nuance. There is a sea of data collected by SpeedCurve and endless ways to interpret that data.New users of the product crave good design and simplicity in an effort to make sense of this firehose of performance information.Power users desire diagnostic capabilities that require extensive use of the latest and greatest browser APIs.Sometimes it&#39;s hard to do both and still provide meaningful information to both audiences.

Here&#39;s a detailed walkthrough showing how to make more meaningful and intuitive attributions for your RUM metrics – which makes it much easier for you to zero in on your performance issues.Real user monitoring (RUM) has always been incredibly important for any organization focused on performance. RUM – also known as field testing – captures performance metrics as real users browse your website and helps you understand how actual users experience your site. But it’s only in the last few years that RUM data has started to become more actionable, allowing you to diagnose what is making your pages slower or less usable for your visitors.Making newer RUM metrics – such as Core Web Vitals – more actionable has been a significant priority for standards bodies. A big part of this shift has been better attribution, so we can tell what&#39;s actually going on when RUM metrics change.Core Web Vitals metrics – like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and Cumulative Layout

Paper cut: (literal) A wound caused by a piece of paper or any thin, sharp material that can slice through skin. (figurative) A trivial-seeming problem that causes a surprising amount of pain.We all love big showy features, and this year we&#39;ve released our share of those. But sometimes it&#39;s the small stuff that can make a big difference. We recently took a look at our backlog of smaller requests from our customers – which we labelled &quot;paper cuts&quot; – and decided to dedicate time to tackle them.Are they all glamorous changes? Maybe not, though some are pretty exciting.Are they worthy of a press release? Ha! We don&#39;t even know how to issue a press release.Will they make your day better and put a smile on your face? We sure hope so.In total, our wonderful development team tackled more than 30 paper cuts!

We&#39;ve made improvements to how we collect RUM data. Most SpeedCurve users won&#39;t see significant changes to Core Web Vitals or other metrics, but for a small number of users some metrics may increase.This post covers:What the changes areHow the changes can affect Core Web Vitals and other metricsWhy we are making the changes nowWhat&#39;s changing?By default, SpeedCurve RUM used to send its main beacon shortly after the load event fires, another soon after the visitor first interacts with the page, and then further beacons as User Timing marks and measures (AKA custom metrics) are added.This approach was sound when our main focus was measuring how quickly pages loaded or routes changed. But newer metrics – such as Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and Interaction to Next Paint (INP) – don&#39;t stop at page load or first interaction. As a result, they need to be measured throughout the entire lifecycle of the page.To work around some of the limitations of the current approach, we&#39;ve added options t

A recent analysis of twenty leading websites found a surprising number of page speed optimizations that sites are not taking advantage of – to the detriment of their performance metrics, and more importantly, to the detriment of their users and ultimately their business.I spend a lot of time looking at waterfall charts and web performance audits. I recently investigated the test results for twenty top sites and discovered that many of them are not taking advantage of optimizations – including some fairly easy low-hanging fruit – that could make their pages faster, their users happier, and their businesses more successful.More on this below, but first, a few important reminders about the impact of page speed on businesses...Slow pages hurt your businessIn user survey after user survey over the past decade or so, site speed has emerged as one of the greatest factors that determine a person&#39;s satisfaction with a website (second only to security).
