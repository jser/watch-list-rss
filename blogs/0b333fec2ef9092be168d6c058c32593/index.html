At Gumroad, we recently embarked on a new project called Helper. As the CEO, I was initially quiteoptimistic about using htmx for this project, even though some team members were less enthusiastic.My optimism stemmed from previous experiences with React, which often felt like overkill for our needs. I thought htmxcould be a good solution to keep our front-end super light. Source with htmx - Click Image To ViewIn fact, I shared this sentiment with our team in Slack:“https://htmx.org/ may be a way of adding simple interactions to start”And initially, it seemed promising! As one of our engineers at Gumroad eloquently put it:“HTMX is (officially) a meme to make fun of how overly complicated the JS landscape has gotten - much like tailwind isjust a different syntax for inline CSS, HTMX is a different syntax for inline JS.”However, unlike Tailwind, which has found its place in our toolkit, htmx didn’t scale for our purposes and didn’t leadto the best user experience for our customers–at leas

Inevitably,someone claims it’s impossible to build a high-quality application without using a single-page application (SPA)framework like React or AngularJS. This strikes me as odd because, even before the SPA revolution, many popularmulti-page web applications offered excellent user experiences.Two years ago, I set out to build an observability platform and chose to experiment with amulti-page application (MPA) approach using HTMX. I wondered: Would a server-rendered MPA be inadequate for a data-heavyapplication, considering that most observability platforms are built on ReactJS?What I discovered is that you can create outstanding server-rendered applications if you pay attention to certaindetails.Here are some common MPA myths and what I’ve learned about them.#Myth 1: MPA Page Transitions are slow because Ja

htmx 2.0.0 ReleaseI’m very happy to announce the release of htmx 2.0. This release ends support for Internet Explorer and tightens up somedefaults, but does not change most of the core functionality or the core API of the library.Note that we are not marking 2.0 as latest in NPMbecause we do not want to force-upgrade users who are relying on non-versioned CDN URLs for htmx. Instead, 1.x willremain latest and the 2.0 line will remain next until Jan 1, 2025. The website, however, will reference 2.0.Major ChangesAll extensions have been moved out of the core repository to their own repoand website: https://extensions.htmx.org. They are now all versioned individually and can be developed outside ofthe normal (slow) htmx release cadence.Most 1.x extensions will work with 2.x, however the SSE extension did have a break and must be upgraded.The older extensions remain in the /dist/ext directory so as to not break the URLs of CDNs like unpkg, but pleasemove to the new extension URLs going forw

As htmx has gotten more popular, it’s reached communities who have never written server-generated HTML before. Dynamic HTML templating was, and still is, the standard way to use many popular web frameworks—like Rails, Django, and Spring—but it is a novel concept for those coming from Single-Page Application (SPA) frameworks—like React and Svelte—where the prevalence of JSX means you never write HTML directly.But have no fear! Writing web applications with HTML templates is a slightly different security model, but it’s no harder than securing a JSX-based application, and in some ways it’s a lot easier.#Who is guide this for?These are web security basics with htmx, but they’re (mostly) not htmx-specific—these concepts are important to know if you’re putting any dynamic, user-generated content on the web.For this guide, you should already have a basic grasp of the semantics of the web, and be familiar with how to write a backend server (in any language).

I have been following htmx for a while now. I thought it was a somewhat funny/cringey memeand that it served as some light comic relief from the real work being done in web development, things likeReact Server Components, Svelte Runesand Signals that are actually pushing the state of the art forward.Unfortunately at some point in the middle of 2023people began to actually take htmx seriously for some reason.This is an extremely alarming turn of events that has me deeply concerned for the future of web development.And I’m not alone in my alarm: you can read an excellent dressing down of htmx here:Basically they put their ignorance on full display, then attribute all sorts of unfounded merits to whatever they’vedone hoping that everyone else pats them on the back for it.So true. So, so true.Unfortunately, the language in that excellent medium post is academic and, without a solid grasp of theoretical HTML,many of the more important points in it will go over a typical web developers head.

A common objection I see to using htmx and hypermedia is something along the lines of:The problem with returning HTML (and not JSON) from your server is that you’d probably also like to serve mobileapps and don’t want to duplicate your APII have already outlined in another essay that I think you should split your JSON API &amp; yourhypermedia API up into separate components.In that essay I explicitly recommend “duplicating” (to an extent) your API, in order todisentangle your “churny” web application API endpoints that return HTML from yourstable, regular &amp; expressive JSON Data API.In looking back at conversations I’ve had around this idea with people, I think that I have been assuming familiaritywith a pattern that many people are not as familiar with as I am: theModel/View/Controller (MVC)pattern.#An MVC IntroI was a little shocked to discover in a recent podcast that many youngerweb developers just don’t have much experience with MVC.

One of the most common criticisms of htmx, usually from people hearing about it for the first time, goes like this:You’re complaining about the complexity of modern frontend frameworks, but your solution is just another complex frontend framework.This is an excellent objection! It’s the right question to ask about any third-party (3P) code that you introduce into your project. Even though you aren’t writing the 3P code yourself, by including it in your project you are committed to understanding it—and refreshing that understanding if you want to upgrade it. That’s a big commitment.Let’s break this criticism down into its constituent parts, and determine exactly how much htmx indulges in the harms it claims to solve.#The difference between a library and a frameworkSome htmx defenders jump to our aid with: “htmx isn’t a framework, it’s a library.” This is probably incorrect.“Framework” is a colloquial term—there’s no hard rule for the point at which some third-party code evolves from a “

I have written a lot about Hypermedia APIs vs. Data (JSON) APIs, including the differences between the two,what REST “really” means and why HATEOASisn’t so bad as long as your API is interacting with a Hypermedia Client.Often when I am engaged in discussions with people coming from the “REST is JSON over HTTP” world (that is, the normalworld) I have to navigate a lot of language and conceptual issues:No, I am not advocating you return HTML as a general purpose API, hypermedia makes for a bad general purpose APIYes, I am advocating tightly coupling your web application to your hypermedia APINo, I do not think that we will ever fix how the industry uses the term RESTYes, I am advocating you split your data API and your hypermedia API upThe last point often strikes people who are used to a single, general purpose JSON API as dumb: why have two APIs when youcan have a single API that can satisfy any number of types of clients?

One objection that we sometimes hear to htmx and hypermedia is some variation of the following:Well, it might work well for something small, but it won’t scale.It is always dangerous to provoke us with essay-fodder and so lets dig into this claim a bit and see if we canshed some light on whether Hypermedia-Driven Applications (HDAs) can scale.#ScalingFirst of all, let’s define the term “scaling” and then the contexts that word can be used in development. In a softwarecontext, scaling typically means the ability of the software to handle “larger” things. Those things can be:More nodes in a general systemMore user requests (scaling your individual applications performance)More features (scaling your codebase)More complex featuresMore developers (scaling your team size)Each of these sense of the word “scaling” demand their own analysis with respect to HDAs.#Scaling Nodes In GeneralAlthough this isn’t of much interest to individual developers making decisions about their own applications,

Not for nothing, Hypercard presaged the web’s critical “#ViewSource” affordance, which allowed people to copy,modify, customize and improve on the things that they found delightful or useful. This affordance was later adaptedby other human-centered projects like #Scratch, and is a powerful tonic against #enshittification.--Cory Doctorow @pluralistic@mamot.fr#Open Culture &amp; The WebWhen people talk about open source software, that conversation is often dominated bythe Free Software Foundation’s notion of free software:“Free software” means software that respects users’ freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have thefreedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.“This definition of free software has been a useful one and, through advocating for it, the FSF has gifted the world alot of wonderful open source software.Web applications, however, have always been an uncomfortable fit for this definition of free.

The Mother of All htmx Demos you can see the real world results of aport from a React-based front end to an htmx-powered front end. The results are very good, although we qualify theexperience with the following:These are eye-popping numbers, and they reflect the fact that the Contexte application is extremely amenable tohypermedia: it is a content-focused application that shows lots of text and images. We would not expect everyweb application to see these sorts of numbers.However, we would expect many applications to see dramatic improvements by adopting the hypermedia/htmx approach, atleast for part of their system.As luck would have it, we have another application (again, based on Django on the server side) that has been ported froma React front end to an htmx front end: OpenUnited.Here is a graphic from the original LinkedIn postby Adrian McPhee, showing the total Lines of Code in the code base before and after the port:#Before/After Source CodeA very nice aspect of this port is th

A recurring question from some htmx contributors is why htmx isn’t written in TypeScript, or, for that matter, why htmx lacks any build step at all. The full htmx source is a single 3,500-line JavaScript file; if you want to contribute to htmx, you do so by modifying the htmx.js file, the same file that gets sent to browsers in production, give or take minification and compression.I do not speak for the htmx project, but I have made a few nontrivial contributions to it, and have been a vocal advocate for retaining this no-build setup every time the issue has arisen. From my perspective, here’s why htmx does not have a build step.#Write Once, Run ForeverThe best reason to write a library in plain JavaScript is that it lasts forever. This is arguably JavaScript’s single most underrated feature.

#REST copy-pastas#Ackshually…I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as REST,is in fact, JSON/RPC, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, REST-less.JSON is not a hypermedia unto itself, but rather a plain data format madeuseful by out of band information as defined by swagger documentation orsimilar.Many computer users work with a canonical version of REST every day,without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of RESTwhich is widely used today is often called “The Web”, and many of its users arenot aware that it is basically the REST-ful architecture, defined by Roy Fielding.There really is a REST, and these people are using it, but it is just apart of The Web they use. REST is the network architecture: hypermedia encodes the stateof resources for hypermedia clients.

We have asserted, for a while now, that a major reason that many people have adopted the SPA architecture for web applicationsis due to aesthetic considerations.As we mention in our book Hypermedia Systems, whendiscussing the Web 1.0-style contact management application we begin with, there are serious aesthetic issues withthe application, even if it has feature-parity with an SPA version:From a user experience perspective: there is a noticeable refresh when you move between pages of the application, or when you create, update ordelete a contact. This is because every user interaction (link click or form submission) requires a full pagerefresh, with a whole new HTML document to process after each action.–Hypermedia Systems - Chapter 5This jarring “ka-chunk” between webpages, often with a Flash of Unstyled Contenthas been with us forever and, while modern browsers have improved the situation somewhat (while, unfortunately, also makingit less obvious that a request is in flight) the situ

Often, when we are being insufferably pedantic in online discussionsabout REST &amp; HATEOAS, we willsay something along the lines of this:JSON isn’t a hypermedia because it doesn’t have hypermedia controls.Look at this JSON:{ &quot;account&quot;: { &quot;account_number&quot;: 12345, &quot;balance&quot;: { &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;usd&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 50.00 }, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;open&quot; }}See? No hypermedia controls.So this JSON isn’t a hypermedia, and, therefore, the API returning this JSON isn’t RESTful.To this, occasionally, a smart and experienced web developer will reply with something along these lines:OK, mr. REST-y pants, how about this JSON?{ &quot;account&quot;: { &quot;account_number&quot;: 12345, &quot;balance&quot;: { &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;usd&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 50.00 }, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;open&quot;, &quot;links&quot;: { &quot;deposits&quot;: &quot;/accounts/12345/deposits&quot;, &quot;withdrawals&quot;: &quot;/accounts/12345/withdrawals&quot;, &quot;transfers&quot;: &quot;/accounts/12345/transfers&quot;, &quot;close-requests&quot;: &quot;/accounts/12345/close-requests&quot; } }}There, now there are hypermedia controls in this response (normal humans call them links, btw) so this

The final addition to our constraint set for REST comes from the code-on-demand style of Section 3.5.3 (Figure 5-8).REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented. Allowing features to bedownloaded after deployment improves system extensibility. However, it also reduces visibility, and thus is only anoptional constraint within REST.--Roy Fielding - Representational State Transfer (REST)#Scripting &amp; The WebIn Hypermedia-Driven Applications we discuss how to buildweb applications in such a manner that they are hypermedia-driven, in contrast with the popular SPA approach, in whichthey are JavaScript and, at the network-level, RPC-driven.In the HDA article we mention scripting briefly:In an HDA, hypermedia (HTML) is the primary medium for building the application, which means that:All communication with the server is still managed vi

The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades efficiency, since information is transferred in astandardized form rather than one which is specific to an application’s needs. The REST interface is designed to beefficient for large-grain hypermedia data transfer, optimizing for the common case of the Web, but resulting in aninterface that is not optimal for other forms of architectural interaction.-Roy Fielding, https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5We are obviously fans of hypermedia and think that it can address, at least in part, many of the problems that the webdevelopment world is facing today:Hypermedia is often significantly less complex than an SPA approach wouldbe for many problemsHypermedia allows your application API to be much more aggressively refactored and optimizedHypermedia takes pressure off adopting a particular server technology, since you do not have an extensive JavaScriptfront-end code baseWith htmx and the a

It is all well and good talking about REST &amp; HATEOAS in theory or describing theHypermedia-Driven Application architecture, but, at the end of the day, whatmatters in software is practical: Does it work? Does it improve things?We can say for sure that htmx works, since we use it in our own software.

Template fragments are a relatively rare Server Side Rendering (SSR) template library feature that allow you to render afragment or partial bit of the content within a template, rather than the entire template. This feature is very handy inHypermedia Driven Applications because it allows you to decompose a particularview for partial updates internally without pulling fragments of the template out to separate files for rendering,creating a large number of individual template files.By keeping all the HTML in a single file, it is also easier to reason about how a feature works. This follows theLocality of Behavior design principle.#MotivationLet’s look at how template fragments, in an obscure templating language for java calledchill templates, can help us build an HDA.Here is a simple chill template, /contacts/detail.html that displays a contact:#/contacts/detail.html&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div hx-target=&quot;this&quot;&gt; #if contact.archived &lt;button hx-patch=&quot;/contacts/${contact.id}/unarchive&quot;&gt;Unarchive&lt;/b

pre { margin: 32px !important; }#Tapping The SignI am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP-based interface a REST API. Today’s example is theSocialSite REST API. That is RPC. It screams RPC. There is so much coupling on display that it should be given anX rating.What needs to be done to make the REST architectural style clear on the notion that hypertext is a constraint? Inother words, if the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannotbe RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period. Is there some broken manual somewhere that needs to be fixed?–Roy Fielding, Creator of the term REST REST APIs must be hypertext-drivenREST must be the most broadly misused technical termin computer programming history.I can’t think of anything else that comes close.Today, when someone uses the term REST, they are nearly always discussing a JSON-based API using HTTP.When you see a job post mentioning REST or a company discussing REST Gu

HATEOAS#Preface: HATEOAS — An Alternative ExplanationThis page is a reworking on the Wikipedia Entry on HATEOAS, which uses JSON.Here we use HTML to explain the concept, and contrast it with JSON APIs. It is a more opinionated explanation of theconcept than would be appropriate for Wikipedia, but it is more correct in our opinion.Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is a constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures.With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia. A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.By contrast, today JSON-based web clients typically interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation via a toolsuch as swagger.The restrictions imposed by HATEOAS decouples client and server.

The most familiar form of thislatter style of API today is the ubiquitous JSON API.These two different types of API have distinctly different design needs and, therefore, should use different designconstraints and adopt different goals when being created.Hypermedia APIs:Will be trivially REST-ful, since they are simply what Roy Fielding was describing.Should be driven by the needs of the underlying hypermedia applicationMay change dramatically without versioning information, because hypermedia utilizes self describing messagesShould be passed directly to humans, to maximize the flexibility of the systemData APIs, on the other hand:Will not benefit dramatically from REST-fulness, beyond perhaps Level 2 of the Richardson Maturity ModelShould strive for both regularity and expressiveness due to the arbitrary data needs of consumers

There is no topic that generates more confusion in web development than the idea of Representational State Transfer,known as REST. This term comes from Chapter 5of Roy Fielding’s PhD thesis at U.C. Irvine.In this essay we will go through this Chapter and summarize the important concepts for non-academic web developers. Thethesis is dense and involves a lot of technical jargon that isn’t relevant to people who aren’t academics interestedin formal PhD thesis writing.By the end of this essay you should have a better handle on REST, and the concept of aUniform Interface in particular.#OverviewThe first thing to understand about REST is that it is a description of the original web. Fielding describes REST as an“architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems”, which sounds fancy but just means the web we all know and love:clicking on hyperlinks, submitting forms, looking at images, reading paragraphs and all that jazz.It was NOT created as a description of a particular approach for J

Every software project involves managing a complexity budget.A complexity budget can be defined as:An explicit or implicit allocation of complexity across the entire application“Complexity” here is defined subjectively (rather than formally)and in Stewartian Terms: “I know it when I see it.”Or, more specifically to software development: “I know it when I feel it.”One of the primary jobs of an application architect is to manage a projects complexity budget:Decide if a given feature is “worth it”Decide if a given implementation is “worth it”Add appropriate system boundaries to limit complexity between componentsAnd so onAn infuriating aspect of complexity is that that attempts to address it can, in fact, add more complexity.A good example of this from experience was when a company I worked at added OSGi to the system to manage theincreasing complexity of the project.

Recently Tom MacWright has written a few posts on Single Page Applications and their discontents:Second-guessing the modern webIf not SPAs, What?The emerging norm for web development is to build a React single-page application, with server rendering. The two keyelements of this architecture are something like:The main UI is built &amp; updated in JavaScript using React or something similar.The backend is an API that that application makes requests against.This idea has really swept the internet. It started with a few major popular websites and has crept into cornerslike marketing sites and blogs.In these two articles Tom lays out the problem associated with the React/SPA everywhere mindset. If I can summarizethem in one sentence: SPA frameworks tend to be complex, and you don’t get a lot of benefit for all thatcomplexity in many cases.#An AlternativeTom outlines a few alternatives to the SPA approach in the second article and, I’m happy to say, mentions htmx.

It’s alsoa lot easier to search twitter &amp; reddit for that term.It’s a simple fix for anyone who actually used 0.0.1:attributes go from kt- to hx- (their original prefix)request headers go from X-KT- to X-HX-kutty goes to htmx for event names, etc.ChangesOK, so besides the big re-rename, what changed?A bug fix for the hx-prompt attributeA bug fix for multiple hx-swap-o

Kutty 0.0.1 ReleaseI’m pleased to announce the 0.0.1 release of kutty, the successorto intercooler.js!Like intercooler, kutty brings features of modern browsers that normally require javascript (AJAX, CSS transitions, etc.)directly into HTML.Why the rename?I chose to rename the project for a few reasons:I wanted the freedom to clean up mistakes and remove ideas that hadn’t worked out as cleanly as I wantedThe JS in intercooler.js implied a javascript-orientation. The more I developed intercooler the more I realizedthat it was really about enhancing (completing?) HTML, not javascript. This project doesn’t really compete with toolslike angular, vue or react, it’s something different, so I wanted a different name.kutty is short and memorable, kutty.org was available, and it has consonance with “cuttlefish” which is theofficial cephalopod of kutty development.So what’s new &amp; different about kutty vs. intercooler?First and foremost, kutty has no external dependencies !No more dragging in jQ
