Last May, Apple announced a new feature called Vehicle Motion Cues for their iOS devices.

This feature would have been a nice relief for me, but as it stands, I use Android.Instead of buying a Malus fruit device, I took the matter into my own programmer hands. I created an alternative app for Android.To be sure, I checked the patents. Apple does have one regarding a certain motion sickness solution, but it’s specifically for head-mounted displays, not handheld devices. I figured it’s because there is prior art for handheld devices, such as KineStop for Android by Urbandroid🡵.My app is called EasyQueasy. What it does is display onscreen vestibular signals that try to help prevent motion sickness. This functions as an overlay that is displayed on top of whatever you’re doing, browsing the web or watching videos.The app is op...

AI art is not generative art (clickbait title). While the technical definition says that one is a subset of the other, I think it’s useful to distinguish between these two categories.Why I’m writing this in the first place — Starting 2022, the term “generative art” had been progressively becoming synonymous with art produced by AI text-to-image systems. As a consumer and producer of (traditional) generative art, it was becoming a bit annoying to browse generative art content on the internet. Whether through tags like #generativeart or communities like r/generative, spaces are being flooded with AI-generated images which I and many others are not interested in. End rant.In 2024, things are a bit different. AI art is now commonly referred to as ‘AI art’. I shouldn’t have procrastinated writing this post for so long.There are also cases where generative artists are pressured to relabel their art, so as to not be mistaken for being AI (and avoid things associated with it). It’s an unfortun

For RSS readers: This article contains interactive content available on the original post on leanrada.com.Sweep-and-prune is my go-to algorithm when I want to quickly implement collision detection for a game. I think it’s an awesome and elegant algorithm, so I wrote a post about it.This post is lengthy with many examples and explanations, thus split into two parts. You can jump to specific bits using this special springboard:Part 1: Simplified version 🔍 Visual comparison📝 CodePart 2: Sophisticated versions 🔍 Visual comparison📝 Final codeAs for the rest of the post, I try to paint a picture of what I think are first principles and show it with interactive demos! Let’s go!Collision detectionAs you may know, the problem of collision detection is pretty common in video game programming. It’s a prerequisite to the implementation of certain game mechanics or simulations.Goombas collidingSome of these mechanics include: preventing characters from passing through each other, goombas🡵 turn...

However, I felt like the genre has become formulaic. Nowadays, we have standardised light, shadow, and noise mechanics.

Notepad.exeinside the editor UI, like this one. Watch out for the insides! ._____________.Macromedia Flash 8What is Macromedia Flash? Macromedia Flash, or just Flash, was a Web browser plugin that everyone had back in the day before JS was powerful enough. It was used for animations, interactive experiences, Web games, Web ads, YouTube, you name it. It was the platform of all webapps before the term webapp became a thing. It was also the name of the authoring software, or IDE. This IDE, as you can see, was very much focused on the graphics and animation part of the authoring experience, not so much on the programming side of rich Web applications. Scripts existed merely as augmentation of objects in the scene. 6/10 for me.

For RSS readers: This article contains interactive content available on the original post on leanrada.com.As a software developer, I’m always looking for new and fun ways to challenge myself. Some time ago, I decided to implement tic-tac-toe with AI using only HTML and CSS. That is, no JavaScript! I already knew about the possibility of advanced CSS interactions (e.g. fancy checkboxes), but I wanted to see how far I could take it.Here’s a CodePen of it! Can you beat a style sheet in a game of tic-tac-toe?See the Pen Pure CSS Tic Tac Toe AI by Kalabasa (@kalabasa) on CodePen. In this post, I’ll write about the steps I took to make it, starting with the fundamentals.Building blocksBefore starting to build anything complex, it’s important to start small and think about the basic elements. Unlike JavaScript, HTML and CSS are declarative languages. We can’t have procedures or functions, control flow, if-statements, and the like. Instead what we have are markup and rules. We’ll build upon th

For RSS readers: This article contains interactive content available on the original post on leanrada.com.This post is about how I achieved the power of 15 keys using just 4 keys on the keyboard. I go over the motivation, the design, and the implementation. At the end, I wrap the solution into a small library. Maybe you’ll find it useful!RationaleI use a compact keyboard called the Lily58 as my main keyboard. It’s a column-staggered split keyboard.The Lily58 keyboard. Photo from github.com/kata0510/Lily58As the name implies, it has only 58 buttons instead of the normal 80+ buttons. Space was limited and it was hard to fit all the letters, numbers, symbols, and other unique keys that I need.The function keys (F1, F2, F3, etc) were particularly cumbersome. I don’t use them very often, yet they take a lot of space. You can see with my previous function key layout that they’re not very space-efficient:My previous layout with function keys on the right half of the keyboard. It’s on a layer

Hi there! I want to share my experience with an image recognition🡵 problem I faced in an art project (It was an augmented reality art project).Image recognition problems come in different forms.As part of the project, I needed a mobile app to be able to recognize a particular art piece. Then it can overlay virtual effects onto the real-world image. The goal was to have a unique and engaging experience!The app should recognize when the target art piece has been aligned.There are various solutions available for tackling this problem, ranging from basic histogram matching to advanced convolutional neural networks. There are even libraries that can provide a solution right out of the box! But I decided to take on the challenge of developing my own solution instead of relying on existing tools. Not only did this allow me to learn something new, but it also let me have some fun approaching the problem!TL;DR - It converts the camera image into a feature vector and then compares that against ...

Pong AINeural networks &amp; genetic algorithmsNeural nets🡵 have been around since the 1950s/60s. This Pong AI experiment was done back in 2014, around the time when a revival in neural networks was accelerating, that later brought about the deep learning, modern artificial intelligence that we associate with the term &quot;AI&quot; nowadays.The Pong AI here, hovewer, has nothing to do with that deep stuff. I was largely unaware of those new developments in AI back then. This one is a very simple implementation of a 3-layer feedforward neural network🡵.The inputs of the network are ball position, heading, paddle position, etc. and the outputs directly control the paddle.Visualization of the network. Sorry about the pixelation (it was a product of that time).Instead of the usual backpropagation🡵, the learning method I used here was a genetic algorithm🡵. It’s an evolutionary algorithm that mimics natural selection, reproduction, and mutation to optimize the neural network’s weights. This was how th...
