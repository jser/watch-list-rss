Over the past few decades, securing remote access has become monumentally more complex. Remote work, with all of its benefits, has also furthered the threats of shadow IT and unauthorized remote access.Companies now need to secure their systems by guarding five pillars: identities, applications, devices, data, and networks.Even so, there’s a gap between the people, devices, and applications that we trust to access sensitive data, and those that actually do in practice (this is called the “Access-trust Gap”). As such, we created 1Password Extended Access Management® to give companies complete visibility and control over the user identities and devices that access their resources.When it comes to securing data at the network level, companies have various options to add to their security stack. Two such options are Tailscale and Twingate.Tailscale and Twingate each take different approaches to better fortify remote network access. Where Tailscale seeks to improve and modernize VPN securit

Tl;dr: This blog discusses IDC’s 2024 study, “The Future of Access Management: Identity Security Requirements for a Modern Application Access Approach.” The study identifies the biggest challenges facing security leaders today, especially those exacerbated by hybrid work. Below are IDC’s findings as well as downloadable checklists that security practitioners can use to address the security gaps in their organizations.IDC ran a recent survey of over 600 international enterprises about the key issues they face in identity and access management (IAM), including a ranking of “organizational risk by user entity.” The top four riskiest groups they named were: hybrid/remote employees; partners, suppliers, and affiliates; machine identities; contractors.There is a shared challenge across all four groups: they are underserved by traditional security tools, and their risk has been exacerbated by the rise in remote work.In a nutshell, it’s more difficult to confidently ascertain a user’s (or devi

In this article, we discuss how admins can programmatically access Spotlight using a utility called osquery, and we demonstrate useful queries you can run to find evidence of compromise in your organization.Have you ever wanted to find exactly the right file on your system in a hurry?That’s why those clever folks at Apple built Spotlight.Originally introduced in Mac OS X Tiger, Spotlight continuously maintains an index of all of the files on your Mac, which allows you to instantly search for files not just by their names, but by their metadata, and even the text content inside of them.I lean on Spotlight heavily every day, to quickly locate and pull up the right design assets from the 1000+ Sketch files on my system.While the benefits of Spotlight as a user of macOS are obvious and intuitive, admins may be surprised to learn you can leverage this powerful feature across your Mac fleet to hunt for evidence of malware, data breaches, and other undesirable artifacts in your end-users&#39; dev

In this blog, we summarize the results of a fall 2022 survey of IT, helpdesk, and security professionals about how their companies protect sensitive data.This article pulls heavily from the Sensitive Data Report, which was originally conducted by Kolide, and as such, uses Kolide’s name and branding. Now that the team at Kolide has happily joined our team at 1Password, we wanted to share the insights and information from this survey with our audience. Rather than edit the report after the fact, we’ve left it as-is, in order to preserve the integrity of the information as it was originally gathered.According to William Crowell’s famous quip, “the cybersecurity industry is a thousand points of light and no illumination.” And according to our new study, one of the darkest places in the entire field of security may be an employee’s downloads folder.In fall 2022, we partnered with Dimensional Research to survey IT, helpdesk, and security professionals about how their companies protect sensit

Passkeys are superior to passwords in almost every way. They’re simpler to use because there’s nothing to memorize, type out, or paste in. They’re also always strong and come with multi-factor authentication built right in. In short, passkeys are awesome.But why are passkeys almost always better than passwords? What’s the catch?At the moment, you can’t securely move your passkeys between different password managers. It’s a technical shortcoming that we’re committed to solving, and now, after many months of thinking, prototyping, and discussing it with other security companies, we have some news to share.Introducing two draft passkey specificationsToday, the FIDO Alliance has published a working draft of a new set of specifications that, once implemented by major passkey providers, will allow you to import and export passkeys in a way that’s both convenient and secure.The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association with a mission to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords. 1Password

It’s easy for technology companies to claim they’re a force for good. As the age-old saying goes, actions speak louder than words.For this year’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has chosen the theme “Secure Our World”. It’s a reminder that everyone has a right to privacy and the tools, support, and knowledge required to protect their data.

In this article, we compare the various difficulties and costs associated with trying to build your own osquery solution vs buying 1Password’s osquery-based device trust product.Note to readers: This article was initially written in late 2022. We’ve done our best to update all of its information and advice, but be sure to do your due diligence when researching further! And of course, you can always reach out to our team with any questions.When you’re making the case for your company to buy 1Password® Extended Access Management, executives and technical procurement managers will inevitably ask if you’ve considered alternatives. And since 1Password Extended Access Management’s Device Trust solution uses osquery, an open-source software, you should expect that one of those proposed alternatives will be building it yourself.This should be no surprise; osquery is the most popular open-source endpoint security project on GitHub.

This article explains how, with 1Password’s Device Trust solution, you can use osquery’s file monitoring capabilities to oversee your Windows fleet.Note: This article was written in 2022. We wanted to share it since the information about setting up Windows FIM with osquery is still highly valuable. Even so, the specific UX and admin flow detailed here may have seen minor changes over time. If you ever need help, feel free to reach out with any questions! Our door’s always open for fellow osquery fans.Prior to Osquery 4.2.0, Osquery’s File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) capabilities only worked on macOS and supported versions of Linux.

The rise of cloud-based SaaS apps have shifted the threat landscape, and security has broadly shifted to a Zero Trust model. Despite that, corporate VPNs still provide value and the companies that have them aren’t rushing to get rid of them any time soon.Let me set the scene.

Monitoring employees in the name of productivity or security can cause a lot more problems than it solves.On Halloween 2022, National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo released a memo that likely horrified plenty of executives. She announced her intention to “protect employees … from intrusive or abusive electronic monitoring and automated management practices.”In other words, the NLRB declared war on bossware. And it’s not alone. Beyond Abruzzo’s memo lies an evolving, growing array of laws and regulations that seek to protect employees&#39; privacy rights against employee monitoring software, otherwise known as bossware.Numerous countries and a handful of US states, such as California and New York, have already imposed restrictions on how companies can digitally surveil their employees.

How worried should small businesses be about cyber attacks? Pretty worried, according to Alan Watkins, a professor for the Cybersecurity Master’s Degree Program at National University, and an expert with a long career in cybersecurity, emergency management, and law enforcement.Small businesses are often at a higher risk because criminals know they’re easier to hack. So, what’s a small business to do?

This blog post describes the process for securely updating 1Password’s Device Trust agent.From a user’s perspective, the agent update process for 1Password Device Trust is functionally invisible. Most users are familiar with having to download new updates for software, or at least having to click “yes” on a prompt to restart an app so that it can update. But the Device Trust agent doesn’t require any action from the user to update – it securely autoupdates itself and its components.Given device trust’s importance as a security tool and its role in user authentication, it’s really important that the autoupdate process be as secure as possible. So let’s explain why we chose this approach, and how we ensure that our process is secure.How and why do we autoupdate the Device Trust agent?The 1Password Device Trust agent autoupdates itself in order to receive new features, improvements, and fixes as quickly as possible.At a high level, these are the steps in the autoupdate process:Once an hou

Many people are turning to personal VPNs in order to avoid increasing restrictions and oversight over online browsing, but these VPNs can represent risks to personal and corporate cybersecurity.There’s a widespread consensus these days about the evolution of life online: the internet is getting worse. We were trained to expect digital services that were cheap and easy, but lately they have become expensive, invasive, or simply impossible.Streaming prices keep increasing while streaming content keeps disappearing, news stories are aggressively paywalled, and sixteen states (so far) have passed laws requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of their users, often by sharing their driver’s licenses.These changes are driving users onto the gray market of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which promise a private, secure browsing experience that lets them get around these restrictions.

In emergency situations, 1Password® Extended Access Management can get devices patched faster than MDM alone.On February 13th, 2023, Apple released a series of OS updates to quickly mitigate several serious vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-23514 and CVE-2023-23529) in macOS and Safari. It appeared to be a worst-case scenario: a motivated unauthorized third-party could craft a specific payload to execute arbitrary code on unpatched devices.This type of emergency patching situation is unfortunately all too common, and yet most admins don’t have good tools to effectively hasten the speed these devices get patched. With 1Password Extended Access Management’s integration with identity providers like Okta, Microsoft Entra, and Google Workspace, IT admins now have a powerful capability to patch devices faster than ever.

Together, CrowdStrike and 1Password are working to ensure every identity, application, and device is protected from threats. Now, you can get the combined power of 1Password and CrowdStrike for less when you bundle 1Password Extended Access Management and CrowdStrike Falcon Go.Too much to do, and not enough time can often feel like the mantra for IT teams. But, with 70% of cyber attacks targeting small businesses, those responsible for business security need to make sure it’s a top priority. However, the constantly evolving security landscape doesn’t make that easy.That’s why more and more small business IT teams are looking for comprehensive security solutions. In fact, nearly one in three teams (30%) have switched security tools or vendors in the past year to ones that provide more complete end-to-end solutions.

Need help proving compliance with your Windows fleet? We have good news for Microsoft Entra users. Want to skip the preamble? Go right to the osquery SQL at the end of this article.Third-party malware detection and prevention (what we used to call antivirus) is not every Mac admin’s cup of tea. Some have bigger fish to fry (e.g., getting endpoint visibility); others are content with the built-in anti-malware capabilities of macOS and thus have no plans to deploy AV on its merits.Unfortunately, SOC 2 and similar audits are forcing both types of Mac a

But before we dig into the details, let’s start at the beginning.What is an ATC table?ATC (automatic table construction) is a method which can expose the contents of local SQLite database files as an osquery virtual table.ATC was added to osquery by Mitchell Grenier (obelisk) in response to a number of virtual table pull requests which all functioned by parsing SQLite databases. Rather than approving each table as a separate pull request, Mitchell took the opportunity to add a native SQLite parsing method to osquery, which would allow adding any number of new virtual tables on a customizable basis.Why is parsing SQLite DBs useful?Many applications use SQLite databases as a storage method for applicat

California’s data protection law applies not just to consumers, but to employees. And it’s finally taking effect.Some revolutions happen overnight. In 1917, it took Russian citizens a little over a week to overthrow centuries of Czarist rule. A new world was born in less time than it takes a loaf of bread to get moldy.Other revolutions are slow, incremental, and involve a lot of paperwork. Such is the case with the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the first state privacy law that includes protections for employees. For this part of the law, the path to enforcement has looked a little like a game of Chutes and Ladders: big advancements followed by equally big setbacks.First, although other aspects of the law took effect in January 2023, employers were given a six month grace period to get compliant, until July 2023. Then, the California Chamber of Commerce won a trial court ruling that extended the grace period until March 2024. Then a California Court of Appeal overturned

For companies looking to get their data practices in order, the ISO 2700 standards provide a valuable starting point to use when crafting policy.The Wild West era of data privacy and cybersecurity is coming to an end. The public has soured on companies (including Big Tech) that scooped up their personal data and then failed to protect it from breaches, hacks, and their own worst impulses. And companies themselves have come to see that no industry is safe, as hackers hold hospitals for ransom and paralyze the operations of everything from airlines to casinos.If we were in a Western movie, this would be the part where the townsfolk pray for a Sheriff to show up and restore order, or at least come up with some rules that everyone can agree to follow. And at present, the most comprehensive set of rules is the ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards.What is the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards?The ISO 27000 series is a collection of best practices for how organizations can manage information sec

When the medical mission is at odds with security policies, patients and clinicians suffer.Do you suffer from nosocomephobia, the intense fear of hospitals?Maybe it’s because you’re afraid of blood, disease, or fluorescent lighting, but there’s another risk to consider – your data.Hospitals and healthcare more generally are at some of the greatest risk for cyberattacks of any industry. A 2023 Ponemon Institute study found that 88% of healthcare organizations had at least one cyber attack over the past 12 months, and were specifically susceptible to ransomware and business email compromise (BEC) attacks.It’s easy to see why. Threats actors know how sensitive healthcare data is: if they release patient medical records, the provider’s reputation is ruined. And if they shut down a hospital’s operations by locking down their systems, people die. 43% of respondents in the Ponemon study said a data loss or exfiltration event impacted patient care.

For bad actors, using synthetic voices is easy, cheap, and worryingly effective.In 1989, Mel Blanc, the originator and primary performer of Bugs Bunny, passed away. This left Warner Brothers with a major casting problem. Mel’s performance was pretty distinctive, and finding someone who could do a perfect Bugs (the wry nasal quality, the vague New York accent) seemed an impossible task.Until Jeff Bergman brought two tapes to his audition. One featured Mel Blanc voicing Bugs, while on the other Bergman did his version of the rascally rabbit. In the audition, Bergman played the two recordings and asked if anyone in the room could tell the difference. Nobody could, and Bergman got the job.Thirty years later, another gifted impressionist managed to mimic their way to a paycheck.

The Action Office II would provide privacy while still fostering communication. It would encourage workers to move more freely and adapt their space to their needs. Its innovative movable walls would make workers happier, healthier, and more productive than ever!It was a daring, forward-looking plan, but below, we have a picture of what that plan looked like in the real world.SourceYup. The Action Office II is now best known for giving us the dreaded cubicle. The bane of the modern office worker. The rat maze of the rat race.The birth of the cubicle illustrates how workplace technologies often start as exciting ideas, but are then reshaped by man

1Password® Extended Access Management includes (among other things) a device trust agent.This agent serves as part of a user’s authentication process with their company’s SSO – for instance, Okta.What that means is that, with 1Password Extended Access Management, when devices are out of compliance, users can’t log into their Okta-protected cloud apps until they’ve resolved the issue.This change has several implications for IT admins and end users:End users can no longer ignore device security problems – they have to fix them in order to do their jobs.IT teams can ensure that your entire fleet gets compliant with no interventions from them, which is particularly important for urgent security issues like browser and OS patching.1Password Extended Access Management can help your team with its Zero Trust/device trust initiative since we now restrict access to sensitive resources based on device health.For now, 1Password Extended Access Management is compatible with Okta and Microsoft Entra

If you work on a small team, designing by vibes (also known as intuition-based design) might feel like a natural and convenient way to get things done. The rules of design are understood, even if they’re often unspoken, and there’s no pesky documentation to get in the way.But as your design team grows it can be very difficult to design by intuition alone. The vibe starts to fracture, and people start to produce work that looks and feels quite different. When you don’t have a shared language to pull from, your meetings get much longer or you create a very inconsistent product experience. In some cases, both. Which is frustrating for the design team and their customers.Vibes don’t scaleTo be clear, intuition is and can be a very useful tool. But when it comes to design, intuition alone isn’t enough to make good decisions. Gut feel should be a signal, but you also need to make sure you have a repeatable approach. Otherwise it’s hard to take the decisions you made in one project and apply

With 1Password Extended Access Management, customers can now require users to secure unencrypted SSH keys on their devices by importing them into 1Password before they can access sensitive company data.Like many, you might assume that software developers have an advantage over non-technical end users when securing their devices. After all, they understand how computers work at a deep level, and reasoning about security is a significant part of software engineering.Not exactly. Software engineers have access to organizations&#39; most sensitive systems and intellectual property, but they are also the most likely group to successfully advocate to be an exception to the security and IT team’s normal practices. Additionally, they regularly encounter, handle, and even generate sensitive credentials, making them a prime target for bad actors. In fact, in Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report, the top “initial action” taken by attackers in the breaches analyzed was “stolen credentials.

Five years ago, the SwiftUI framework was revealed at WWDC19, offering developers a new way to build apps on Apple platforms.Despite the framework’s infancy, its simplicity and clarity in developing user interfaces displayed incredible potential. That’s why when we started working on 1Password 8 in early 2020, we decided to go all-in on SwiftUI for our iOS app. After all, it was being touted as the future of UI development on Apple platforms.Since then, SwiftUI has served us really well. It’s helped our team bring 1Password 8 for iOS to life and move quicker than ever in delivering new, exciting features to users. We’re having a great time with SwiftUI today but it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for everything we’ve needed to build.

In theory, patch management should be trivially easy for a company to manage.An IT team – potentially helped by an MDM, a dedicated patch management tool or an MSP – tests and deploys patches, every endpoint gets updated at roughly the same time, and users are barely aware it’s happening at all.Most articles about patch and vulnerability management describe this idealized flow as if it represents the real world.SourceBut the situation look a little different on the ground.SourceIn reality, IT teams are constantly battling a never-ending torrent of updates and constantly falling behind; Security Navigator’s research shows that businesses still take an average of 215 days to patch a known vulnerability.In vulnerability management, the stakes for just a single error can be monumental. In a Ponemon Institute study, 42% of organizations that suffered a data breach reported it “occurred because a patch was available for a known vulnerability but not applied.”Clearly, patch management is hard

It was a scene straight out of a casino heist movie, but without George Clooney’s suavity to soften the chaos.Various systems at MGM Casinos–ranging from slot machines, to hotel key cards, to escalators–had been shut down. Guests were locked out of their rooms while hotel staff scrambled to compensate, taking food orders with pen and paper and cashing out gambling winnings from a fanny pack.

Few ad campaigns have ever had such a long-lasting impact as the iconic ‘I’m a Mac/I’m a PC’ commercials that ran in the mid-aughts.In those commercials, John Hodgman’s PC was the stuffy, corporate computing option – not good for anything more exciting than a spreadsheet. By contrast, Justin Long’s Mac was the laidback computer you used at home – Mac was your buddy, not your manager.The ad campaign was a smash hit for Apple, but nearly 20 years later, IT admins are still living with the fallout. Because in the years since these commercials aired, something unexpected happened. That friendly, casual Friday computer entered the workforce and loosened Microsoft’s stranglehold on the corporate network.By 2021, Macs made up roughly a quarter of all US enterprise fleets (and we can assume it’s grown significantly, since the most recent data is from before the release of the M1 Macs).

When you tell people you’re writing a piece on cybersecurity insurance, they tend to look at you with a mix of confusion and pity.Even when you interview cyber insurance professionals, they preemptively apologize for boring you.The truth is, cyber liability insurance – like any other kind of insurance – is pretty boring, right up until the point that the people who need it can’t get it. Then it becomes not only interesting, but vital. And that’s the point we’re approaching now.In the past three years, the cost of cyber liability premiums hasn’t so much skyrocketed as it has teleported. In 2021, the cost of cyber insurance increased 25.5% year-over-year, making it the fastest growing premiums of all lines of insurance. 2022 was even worse, with rates doubling in the first quarter and increasing a further 79% in Q2.As of 2024, these massive price jumps have stabilized somewhat, with increased competition in the market even leading to a decline in average premium costs – though prices sti

In life, we’ve all encountered the gaps between the idealized world and the world as it is.You’d love your favorite sports team to have a perfect season, but you’re prepared for them to lose a few games.Retailers want to sell their entire inventory, but they plan for a certain percentage of their goods to be damaged or stolen.IT and security professionals try to ensure that only the right people can access their company’s resources, but acknowledge that some data will inevitably slip through the cracks.These gaps are acceptable, until they are not.When your favorite team loses all its games, it might be time for a new coach (or to stop being a Browns fan). If a store’s merchandise keeps getting shoplifted, they need a security guard.

Companies have to choose authentication methods that balance (sometimes competing) needs for security and usability, which is challenging, since the right choice might be different in 2024 than it was a year ago. The state of the art constantly shifts in response to breakthroughs by both vendors and hackers - like this guy that beat a bank’s “secure” voice recognition software with a free AI tool.Choose the appropriate level of security for the user and resource. The “right” approach to authentication has to be tail

Zero Trust is having a bit of a moment.Okta’s 2023 State of Zero Trust report found that 61% of organizations globally have a defined Zero Trust initiative in place. (That’s up from only 16% of companies in 2018).Yet even as Zero Trust security reaches new heights of popularity (including via executive order), a backlash is brewing among professionals, who feel the term is being diluted past all usefulness.At security conferences, endless lines of vendors hawk products, all dubiously labeled “ZTA.” Companies crow about their Zero Trust initiatives while privately making as many exceptions as there are rules. Charlie Winckless, senior director analyst for Gartner, puts it this way: “It’s important that organizations look at the capability and not the buzzword that’s wrapped around it.”So which is it – is Zero Trust our best hope against a lawless security landscape, or is it just another disposable tech buzzword?The answer is: a little bit of both. And that begs another question: how di

1Password Business customers can now integrate with Google Identity Platform using OpenID Connect (OIDC). Doing so brings all the benefits of integrating 1Password with your IdP: streamlined access, unified security policies, and improved auditing, compliance, and reporting workflows.Why Google SSO?In short, you asked (thank you to the many 1Password Business customers who provided their input!). Single sign-on (SSO) has become a critical requirement for businesses to simplify access management for both admins and employees. When you integrate 1Password with Google Identity Platform, you make it easier for teams to securely access their passwords, payment info, and all the other business secrets they store in 1Password.Like all identity provider integrations, zero-knowledge architecture and end-to-end encryption are preserved, and decryption happens on-device. And the trusted device model ensures that if your identity provider credentials are ever compromised, attackers still wouldn’t

Diversity brings innovation. At a time when every tech company is looking for an edge, having a workforce that mirrors their heterogeneous customer base is a smart move. But how can tech and cybersecurity companies build new talent pipelines?Self-eSTEM, a non-profit that supports BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) women and girls learning and working in STEM fields is helping to diversify the talent pool. But, as Sara Teare, one of 1Password’s founders discussed with Adamaka Ajaelo, founder and executive director of Self-eSTEM on the Random but Memorable podcast, they can’t do it alone.

Since the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, AI-powered browser extensions have proliferated wildly.There are hundreds of them – search for “AI” in the Chrome Web Store and you’ll get tired of scrolling long before you reach the end of the list.These browser extensions run the gamut in terms of what they promise to do: some will summarize web pages and email for you, some will help you write an essay or a product description, and still others promise to turn plaintext into functional code.The security risks posed by these AI browser extensions also run the gamut: some are straightforward malware just waiting to siphon your data, some are fly-by-night operations with copy + pasted privacy policies, and others are the AI experiments of respected and recognizable brands.We’d argue that no AI-powered browser extension is free from security risk (browser extensions in general are notoriously dangerous) but right now, most companies don’t even have policies in place to assess the types and

When workers bring their own equipment on the job, it opens the door to all kinds of trouble – just ask the NFL.In 2006, the National Football League instituted a rule change that allowed each team’s offense to use their own footballs during games, as long as those footballs met the league’s requirements. This change was made at the request of the league’s quarterbacks, who wanted more control over the equipment they use to throw touchdowns.But in 2015, the NFL’s BYOD policy led to disaster. The New England Patriots and their quarterback Tom Brady were accused of deliberately underinflating footballs below NFL standards, in a scandal known as Deflategate.Whatever you believe about the Patriots&#39; guilt or innocence (please don’t email us), Deflategate illustrates the pitfalls that come with BYOD - how a well-meaning policy can create a culture of mistrust and end up putting the most sensitive devices in your organization at risk.In this piece, we’ll talk about whether or not BYOD policie

Rather than edit the report after the fact, we’ve left it as-is, in order to preserve the integrity of the information as it was originally gathered.Corporate cybersecurity is at something of a turning point.

The first known security incident involving a compromised device occurred during the Bronze Age, in present-day Turkey.In that case, the Trojan guards were good men, not malicious bad actors. But they made a fatal mistake when they failed to inspect the large, horse-shaped device they dragged inside the city gates.You’d think that after 3000 years, we would’ve learned. And yet today, compromised devices are one of the greatest threats to cybersecurity. Employees routinely log into their work accounts with malware-infected devices. Even more commonly, bad actors use their own devices to access sensitive data, with the help of stolen employee credentials.These debilitating hacks and data breaches are driving up cybersecurity insurance premiums and driving interest in potential solutions to secure end user devices. One such class of solutions is device trust.Device trust can also be called device health, device posture, device context, or device assurance. But “trust” is particularly usef

Accuracy is important in just about everything we do, so it’s difficult to think of a situation in which one can be too exact. But it’s not impossible.There’s good ol’ 1Password search, for instance, which is perfectly functional. It’s also overly precise and highly inflexible. When I search the term bank, my bank login is never returned because my financial institution doesn’t have the word bank in its name, and I lacked the foresight to tag every banking-related credential with the appropriate tag. Because I, like you, expected 1Password to just… know.Now it does.With the latest version of 1Password, we’ve introduced a better search experience. Now your item searches are useful and much more helpful thanks to large language models (LLM).Yep, that says LLM. And, yes, LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI).What follows is a deep dive into how we use it securely.Out with the oldBefore we get into how incredible the new is, I think it’s important to understand where we started.In

Note: 1Password has not been compromised. This blog post provides practical tips to protect your organization from a recent string of credential-based breaches.Over the last few months, there have been a number of credential-based breaches, including the attacks on Ticketmaster, Santander Bank, and others.As details regarding this string of attacks continue to be uncovered, it is critical that organizations take precautionary measures in order to protect themselves and their customers from potentially being compromised by cybercriminals. While the details may be murky, it’s likely that cybercriminals are successfully “stuffing” stolen credentials into numerous systems and databases to see what they can unlock. This underscores the consequences of risky behavior many employees have of reusing the same email and password on multiple sites.What happened?Recently, there has been a string of high-profile attacks on large organizations.

The differences between 1Password and Keeper go a lot deeper than passwords.If you’re comparing 1Password and Keeper (and it seems like you are, since you’re reading this article) then it pays to be well-informed before you make a purchase.Keeper and 1Password both provide Enterprise Password Managers (EPMs), which are the foundational products of both companies. So if you’re here to compare password managers, we’ve got you covered.But, while EPMs do a lot to keep systems secure, they work better with the help of a more holistic security suite that goes beyond credential management. Fortunately, this is something that both our companies also offer. Keeper provides a lightweight Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution, while we provide 1Password Extended Access Management.

Passkeys are a great technology that can replace passwords and any number of multi-factor authentication mechanisms. However, they have one major limitation holding them back from fully replacing passwords.While passkeys are a great sign-in method, they can’t be used to encrypt the data associated with your account. Until now, services have been stuck with passwords and other clever key handling methods to encrypt customer data.That’s no longer the case for services that you’ve chosen to protect with a passkey saved in 1Password. Starting with the latest beta versions of our browser extension and 1Password for Android, any service you log in to with a passkey – provided it’s stored in 1Password – can use that same passkey for end-to-end encryption.What does this mean?Let’s say you use an app that protects all of your notes with end-to-end encryption. That means only you have the key required to decrypt and read your notes. Historically this key would be a password. It would be used to

There are moments when stars seem to align, and incredible opportunities present themselves.This is one such moment. Today, we’re proud to announce that 1Password is a global partner of the 2024 Presidents Cup in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.Why sponsor the Presidents Cup?Since our founding, a major cultural value of 1Password is putting people first. When the opportunity presented itself to work with the PGA Tour and sponsor the Presidents Cup, it was evident that we had shared values. Like 1Password, the PGA Tour focuses on giving back and supporting the local communities that host each professional golf tournament. The PGA Tour has donated more than $3.93B to local charities where events take place.That brings us to the Presidents Cup. The Presidents Cup is a global team competition between elite golfers from the United States and internationally (minus Europe).

If you want to make Google tongue-tied, search for ‘MDM for Linux.’At first glance, you’ll find a few vendors who claim to offer device management software for Linux devices (usually as an afterthought to round out their solutions for Mac and Windows). But look closer and you’ll quickly realize that none of these solutions are really MDMs, and none of them will let an IT admin provide endpoint security in the way they’re used to.The absence of an MDM for Linux is a real problem if you’re trying to get your entire fleet of devices aligned to the same standard–for instance, if you’re trying to pass a third-party compliance audit. It’s also just a black eye on your security program when you have no visibility or way to enforce policy on some of your highest-risk devices.So why isn’t there a Linux MDM? And what are you supposed to do now?Let us explain.Why Linux MDMs don’t existMDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions are the most common–and the most aggressive–form of device management. (

In baseball, it’s tempting to think that once you’re on a base, the hard part is over.But then, just when you think you’re safe (you are literally “safe”) the baseman hits you with the hidden ball trick. Your opponent appears to throw the ball away, but merely hides it and tags you in the moment you’re most vulnerable.A similar thing is happening to companies with multi-factor authentication (MFA). The goal of MFA, much like baseball, is to safely get users where they need to go (in this case, authenticated into their apps). For years, MFA has been considered the gold standard of enterprise cybersecurity. However, even when you’re doing everything right, you can be lured into a false sense of security that your opponent is happy to take advantage of.Image SourceTake Retool, for example. They experienced a data breach in August 2023 because a threat actor bypassed not one but three(!) forms of security – VPN, SSO, and Google Authenticator.By deploying phishing, vishing, and Man-In-The-M

The SSO tax is the unofficial name for the practice of software vendors significantly upcharging their customers for Single Sign-On, usually by making it part of an enterprise tier.Opponents of this practice say that charging for SSO is like buying a car and having to pay extra for the seatbelts. Meanwhile, vendors argue that SSO is more like a sunroof: a luxury feature that belongs on their high-end model.In reality, SSO is probably most analogous to a rearview camera; it initially seemed like a fancy add-on, but it’s now recognized as a security requirement that keeps everyone safer.Charging extra for a safety feature strikes plenty of people – like the creators of the SSO Wall of Shame – as unfair and irresponsible, and there’s a backlash against the SSO tax rising in tandem with credential-based hacks that SSO could have helped prevent.Still, even in the face of criticism, the practice of upcharging thousands of dollars for SSO shows no signs of slowing down.

The month of June is Pride Month, which celebrates 2SLGBTQ+ folks (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer plus all the other people that fall under this umbrella). It also honors the Stonewall Riots and the queer liberation protests of 1969. This year in particular marks the 55th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising.2SLGBTQ+ issues have never been more important or talked about in North American society. So it’s important to take a moment to listen to queer voices. It’s an opportunity to recognize that while we still have room to grow, we’ve made significant progress since June 28th, 1969.A brief timeline of progressMany people consider Stonewall to have kicked off the 2SLGBTQ+ movement in the United States, though it was preceded by a decade of similar riots. However, Stonewall is considered a major turning point, with Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and Stormé DeLarverie all playing major roles.

In 2016, the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland fell prey to a vicious and devastating attack.The bad actor exploited a vulnerability that researchers at CERN had never considered – small furry animals.Yes, the Large Hadron Collider, the pinnacle of scientific achievement, was shut down by a weasel. The cunning critter infiltrated their systems (crawled into one of their tubes) and executed a targeted attack (chewed up a power cord). Research into the Higgs-Boson was delayed for weeks while they got systems back online.Image SourceNow, in 2024, CERN is more concerned about an increasingly common (and far less adorable) style of attack: ransomware.

Eighteen years ago we made a decision that forever changed our lives: ‘1Passwd’ went live on the internet!It was a side project that was meant to take three weeks. We had built a tool to fill a need we had - saving passwords and everything else you need to submit on webpages, so they could be stored and shared securely. Along the way, we could use this tool to test how well that information was filled into the page. We did all that so we could get back to building websites and doing our other projects faster.We knew that other people might also like what we had built. But what surprised us was the passion of the community! As soon as we launched 1Passwd on MacUpdate and Version Tracker, we were welcomed with open arms, kicking off what would become an amazing journey to where we are today.Over the last 18 years, it’s been our customers who have continued to inspire and drive us forward, and to continue to make 1Password the most-loved password manager.

Single sign-on (SSO) used to be enough. It’s not anymore.Consider these stats:34% of employees use unsanctioned apps.61% of employees have poor password practices.Credentials are the #1 way attackers gain access to systems.Let’s connect those dots. According to 1Password research, more than one-third of the apps employees use for work are unsanctioned, meaning IT and Security don’t know about them. That’s shadow IT, and because you don’t know about them, you can’t put those logins behind SSO.The same research found that most employees have poor password practices like using weak passwords, or reusing them across multiple services.Finally, credentials are still the primary method for attackers to gain access to systems.So, employees are using weak or reused passwords to log in to unmanaged and unprotected services, leaving attackers&#39; favorite entry point – credentials – vulnerable.SSO solutions can help, of course.

It’s no easy feat for a company to maintain security and enforce standardized policies across a fleet of devices.The proliferation of endpoints and operating systems that employees use to connect to company networks makes protecting sensitive data mind-blowingly complex, especially in remote settings. These challenges often come to a head when a company is seeking a security certification like SOC 2 or ISO 27001 and realizes it can only pass an audit if it can achieve greater visibility and control over its fleet. In such situations, most companies resort to mobile device management (MDM) solutions to give their IT team centralized control over the fleet.In a nutshell, MDM solutions make devices behave in specific ways according to predefined security policies so companies can pass audits, prevent data breaches, and obey data privacy and security laws. Despite the word “mobile” in the name, MDMs often extend to the management of laptops, desktops, and tablets. There are many independen

The system that we use internally to build the code behind our browser extension was put together over half a decade ago. While we were able to iteratively grow it over time to meet our needs, it became slower and slower in the process. Let’s give it a much-needed upgrade!I joined 1Password as an intern back in early 2020. That’s a date with … some interesting memories! One of them is my recollection of how long it took to build our browser extension. At that time my 13 inch-MacBook Pro with an Intel i5 processor and 8GB RAM needed roughly 30 seconds to do a warm build of our extension (a warm build means I’ve already built the extension at least once, and I’m rebuilding it to test some changes I’ve made.) Thirty seconds wasn’t bad by any means but it was long enough to be annoying and I often wished it could be faster.Fast forward to 2024.

In 2022, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the most powerful data privacy law in a generation, was used to fine a nosy neighbor.An unnamed Spanish citizen had two home security cameras pointed toward a public road. This got attention from their city council, who filed a claim with the Spanish data protection authority (AEPD).Home security is one thing, but GDPR has some pretty strict requirements on how citizens’ data can be processed. For one thing, you have to collect only the minimum data necessary for your purpose; recording everyone who passes by your house is going a little overboard. And while the homeowner had hung up a notice about the cameras, it lacked important information, like who owned the recordings.For this, and other issues, the AEPD found the individual in violation of GDPR. They were ordered to move their cameras, hang up notices about the recorded data, and pay a fine of 1,500 euros.Since GDPR enforcement began, plenty of companies have had an uns

There’s one quote from the 2024 RSA conference that I can’t stop thinking about, even though it was originally uttered by Kobe Bryant. Here’s the quote:“Why do you think I’m the best in the world? Because I never get bored with the basics.&quot;That (possibly apocryphal) bit of wisdom was delivered by Etay Maor, Chief Security Strategist at Cato Networks, in a talk called “The Price is WRONG–An Analysis of Security Complexity.” Maor’s message was that as our digital infrastructure has ballooned in size and complexity, so has our attack surface, and too often, security vendors offer siloed, rather than holistic, solutions.That’s an excellent point, but the quote has broader implications for security and IT professionals, and it’s a message I saw repeated over and over at RSA.

Developers can now integrate their applications and services directly with 1Password using software development kits (SDKs) for Python, Javascript, and Go. The SDKs are available as open-source libraries in public beta.Why 1Password SDKs?Customers have been asking for a 1Password API so they can access their vaults and items stored in 1Password via that API. It’s a common request, and a reasonable one. The use cases are endless, and we’re builders and tinkerers by nature, too. But it presents some engineering challenges given 1Password’s unique security model.Building a traditional REST API would require 1Password to decrypt and store sensitive user data on our servers. That’s incompatible with our security model and our commitment to zero-knowledge, end-to-end encryption. Only you hold the keys to decrypt the information you store in 1Password, and we want to keep it that way.Enter the 1Password SDKs. The SDKs can be embedded within your application to decrypt data when and where it’s

Shadow IT – the use of apps or devices outside IT’s oversight – can mean that important business information is at risk of being exposed.Many organizations have rules prohibiting the use of shadow IT. But employees are still finding ways to use tools that help them complete their work more efficiently, if occasionally less securely. So what’s the secret sauce to getting users to be more mindful about security?According to Charlie Livingston, head of infrastructure and security at financial wellbeing platform Wagestream, it’s important to position IT as the go-to partner who works to make employees’ jobs easier – and more secure.Livingston recently shared with 1Password’s Michael “Roo” Fey on the Random but Memorable podcast his insights into how IT and employees can be more collaborative to manage the challenges surrounding shadow IT.Read the interview highlights below or listen to the full episode wherever you like to listen to podcasts.Editor’s note: This interview has been lightly e

Balancing security and productivity is hard. On one hand, IT and Security have an obligation to protect the company. On the other hand, employees are most productive when they can work with the tools they know and love.Between hybrid work, BYOD, and shadow IT, one thing is clear: the way we work has changed; and the way we protect that work should too. Existing access management tools were built for a bygone age when every employee was on-premises; SSO was the way into every application used in the business and every device was managed by IT; and all access happened over corporate networks. But things have rapidly changed since the start of 2020, and these days:Hybrid and remote work have become standard.Employees frequently use unsanctioned applications that they bring in to boost their productivity.Employees and contractors increasingly use their personal devices for work purposes.The tools we use today for identity and access management (IAM) are great at securing access to managed

After speaking with customers, we renamed 1Password Teams and Business private vaults to employee vaults to reduce confusion between work and personal accounts. No functionality is changing – just the name.Each 1Password Teams and Business team member has access to shared vaults and a private vault. When an item is stored in a shared vault, whoever is added to that vault has access to the items stored in it. When an item is stored in the private vault, only the team member has access to that item (unless an individual item is temporarily shared).The confusion arises when someone has access to a work account, like 1Password Business, as well as a personal account, like a 1Password Individual or Families account. If private vaults have the same name across both kinds of account, it’s easy to see how some folks end up accidentally saving personal items to their work account or vice-versa.For that reason, the existence of a private vault in both accounts takes a little explaining to new te

The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report is to security what the Vogue September issue is to fashion: a glossy, buzzy publication that guides the industry’s conversations for an entire year.The 2024 DBIR is no exception – it’s packed with deeply-researched insights, elaborate (and sometimes inscrutable) graphs, and its usual collection of charming footnotes. This year, the authors look at some of the biggest security headlines from the past year, such as the MOVEit hack and its aftermath, and the (surprisingly muted) impact of GenAI on breaches.Still, if you’re a security professional or observer, a lot of the information in the 2024 DBIR will feel depressingly familiar. One fact in particular stands out: in 2024, the overwhelming majority of data breaches can still be traced to credential-based attacks and human error.This trend has held remarkably steady in recent years. The 2020 DBIR reported that “credential theft, social attacks (i.e. phishing and business email compromise),

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently announced that they are investigating a major breach at Sisense, a business intelligence company.1Password is not a Sisense customer nor were we impacted by the Sisense breach.As a result of the breach, it is critical that Sisense customers take action immediately to minimize the impact of any breached credentials. Here is a quick overview of what happened, and a look at what needs to be done to secure your developer secrets to protect against follow-on data breaches.What caused the Sisense breach?According to reporting by Brian Krebs, attackers gained access to Sisense’s self-hosted GitLab environment. From there, they found an unprotected token that gave them full access to the company’s Amazon S3 Buckets. Once they had full access to the company’s cloud environment, they were able to copy and exfiltrate several terabytes of customer data, including millions of access tokens, passwords, and even SSL certificate

There’s one question our Security team hears more than any other: Is my 1Password data vulnerable if my device is compromised or infected with malware?A compromised device involves full control or visibility at the system level1, and password managers like 1Password store data that’s accessible to the system — that’s how they function. In fact, that’s how most typical apps are built.The short answer is: Yes, your secrets are vulnerable to an attacker who’s fully compromised your device, however unlikely that situation may be. And let me be clear that if you’re an everyday internet citizen who browses securely and maintains their devices, worrying about such local threats is probably unnecessary. The longer answer is nuanced, as they so often are, and presents an interesting paradox.So, let’s explore that paradox, then dig right into local threat protections in 1Password.

What’s good for business is often bad for security. That’s the inescapable conclusion of the 1Password State of Enterprise Security Report this year.Here’s the backdrop, and it should be familiar by now: Work has, slowly and then all of a sudden, expanded. No longer confined to the office ecosystem, work happens in coffee shops and at home and at the airport, on company-provided laptops and the shared computer in the living room, on the family iPad and the phones in our pockets.All that work leaves a residue of (often sensitive) data as it flows through managed apps like the company productivity suite and unsanctioned apps like the file-sharing service that a handful of people use, unbeknownst to IT.With the explosion in the number of apps used for work, it’s a good time for employee productivity, and artificial intelligence (AI) has entered the picture to boost output even further.

For most organizations, the answer to the question, “Is it important for your employees to be productive?” is a resounding “Yes!” However, when employees ask to use a tool or app to boost productivity, companies may want to say “yes”, but often find themselves saying “no”.What gives? Security concerns. And they’re legit. Companies are in the midst of experiencing a brave new world called hybrid work.

When daydreaming about the future, it’s fun to imagine faraway, fantastic, and possibly impossible scenarios. Moving sidewalks. Personal jetpacks. Unconfusing TV remotes.But to make the world a better place, we need to balance small improvements with audacious moonshots. As science fiction novelist William Gibson famously put it: “The future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed yet.”A good illustration of that quote can be found in Estonia, where citizens have been using digital identification to vote and access public services for over a decade. Estonia is living in the not-too-distant future, waiting for the rest of us to throw away our laminated ID cards.Delivering these kinds of improvements is easier said than done. The paradox of working at a technology company is that you need to build small but innovative products and features (the future) with tried-and-true approaches (the past). Tight deadlines often discourage experimentation but, in order to stay competitive,

When you work in IT, you have a lot to manage. And while everything can feel critical – keeping the computers on might not mean much if your small business experiences a data breach.According to recent reports, cyber attacks are currently disproportionately targeting small businesses.“70% of cyber attacks target small businesses” – Business InsiderWith the average global cost of a data breach being $4.45 million, many small business owners simply don’t have the capital to survive the damage caused from a cyber attack. From losing critical data, time spent trying to recover, and a loss of customer trust, it’s not surprising that 60% of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that are hacked go out of business within six months.But while the stakes may be high, IT teams can protect their businesses by bumping security up their to-do list and prioritizing proactive security measures.Risks companies faceThere are many different types of cyber attacks businesses need to protect against but

1Password doesn’t just keep your personal and work-related data safe. It also helps you keep them separate – and your company’s 1Password Business accounts include free 1Password Families memberships for all team members.1Password Families is a personal account for you and up to 5 family members. It works in much the same way your business account does – but instead of being owned by the company, you own it. And instead of admins managing the account, family organizers manage it (that’s you, and anyone else you designate).Because you own the account, if you and your employer ever part ways, you can keep using your Families account by simply updating your payment method. Access won’t be interrupted, and the personal data in your account will remain yours, completely unaffected by your departure from your company.Employers never have visibility or access to anything stored in personal accounts.

This is the fourth and final post in a series on how to secure your hybrid workforce. For a complete overview of the topics discussed in this series, download The new perimeter: Access management in a hybrid world.In the initial post in this series, we outlined four key considerations to securing your hybrid workforce: identity, shadow IT, the security vs. productivity tradeoff, and security costs.Now that we’ve seen why identity is the right place to start, and how to secure access to both managed and unmanaged apps, let’s talk about worker productivity and cybersecurity costs.Productivity vs. security is a false tradeoffSecurity software is notoriously hard to use. Instead of making things easier for end users, security tools often introduce new frictions into workflows. Hence the perpetual dance between security and productivity.The situation also pits IT and other employees against each other. IT’s goal is to reduce their attack surface to avoid a security breach. Employees want to

Protecting remote and hybrid work requires securing both identity and devices, regardless of where employees work.At this point, it’s safe to say work has changed. But the reality is that for those yearning for employees to return to the office, hybrid and remote work is the modern “business as usual,” and there is no going back. Unsurprisingly, our new way of work has brought a slew of new security challenges that companies struggle to address.Security is inherently a people problem. And when people no longer predominantly work from a corporate office, relying on security technologies built to secure physical corporate networks, and everything plugged into them, is now creating gaping holes in company defenses.At 1Password, we’ve always put people front and center of security, striving to create products that are easy to use and make employees more productive. By making the productive way to work the secure way to work, we help companies enlist their employees to be a part of their pe

Some apps are sanctioned by the IT/Security team. Many are not.Those apps not managed by IT/Security are, by definition, a blind spot. And because you can’t secure what you can’t see, those unmanaged apps are known as shadow IT.What is shadow IT?Shadow IT is all the apps we use to get things done that haven’t been explicitly approved – and therefore secured – by IT.

It’s easy for leaders to get swept up in the fast-paced and always-on nature of our jobs, leaving little opportunity for downtime.

However, through my own work and career, I’ve noticed an essential truth: everyone needs a hobby or distraction from work. It’s more than just a hobby though – it’s a necessity for maintaining a healthy mind and body.For those who don’t know me well enough just yet, that escape is my tractor.

(We’ll explore the other topics in upcoming posts, so stay tuned.)Recap: The new perimeterIn 2023, 70% of data breaches involved an identity element, which can be a vulnerability as simple as a stolen password. And that number is growing – Forrester expects it to climb to 90% in 2024.This is happening for a number of reasons, but hybrid work is high on the list. Instead of badging in to a secure workplace, or using a VPN to access a secure network, we’re working everywhere: from the office, from home, from the coffee shop, at the airport.And inst

This is the first in a series of four posts on how to secure your hybrid workforce. For a complete overview of the topics discussed in this series, download The new perimeter: Access management in a hybrid world.What is hybrid work?To secure your company, it used to be enough to secure the workplace and its entry points – because work was happening at work. There was a clearly defined perimeter to defend against attackers.In hybrid work environments, work happens everywhere: in the office and at home, at coffee shops and coworking spaces, on laptops and phones and tablets. And to get that work done, we use a lot of apps.Hybrid work – which was a thing well before the pandemic, but was massively accelerated by it – is the new normal we’re all adjusting to. Even now, office attendance is 30% lower than it was pre-pandemic. There’s no going back.Suddenly secure networking, VPNs, endpoint protection, and employer-provided devices (basically the entirety of our old cybersecurity toolset) ar

Starting today, you can review and mitigate potential SSH key security risks in 1Password Watchtower.When was the last time you reviewed the SSH keys on your local disk? Do you know which encryption algorithm your keys use? Is every key secured with a passphrase, or are some stored as plaintext?We take care to protect many of the credentials we work with everyday. But too often we store SSH keys – the keys we use to access servers, databases, and other infrastructure – on the local drive and promptly forget about them.When left unaddressed, insecure and unencrypted SSH keys are security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by bad actors. Just this month, researchers discovered malicious NPM packages designed to upload stolen SSH keys to GitHub. Fortunately both packages were removed before they could be widely distributed, but this was yet another example of malicious actors using open-source package managers to target developers and engineering organizations.A new way to monitor the

It’s January, and 2024 is already seeing two major security announcements with wide-scale implications for security teams. While these announcements may seem disconnected at first, they highlight the continued importance of good password hygiene, and ensuring that employees are protecting themselves online inside and outside of the workplace.Here’s the TL;DR.What happened?Two significant security announcements have been reported:Microsoft email breach - State-backed Russian hackers broke into Microsoft’s email system, including access to the accounts of senior leadership members and the company’s cybersecurity team. The hackers were able to gain access by using “password spraying” and used a single, common password in an attempt to login to multiple accounts.The mother of all breaches (MOAB) - A massive database built from previous breaches, leaks, and private databases across a wide range of business and consumer sites from Twitter and LinkedIn to Adobe and Dropbox has been released b

How does it impact me?”The breach includes over 26 billion records. That’s staggering. And that means if any of your accounts are included (or if you reuse passwords anywhere), you need to take action in order to protect yourself and your family.Here’s the TL;DR.What Happened?A massive database built from previous breaches, leaks, and private databases across a wide range of business and consumer sites from Twitter and LinkedIn to Adobe and Dropbox has been released by an unknown source.

Ready to go truly passwordless? Starting today, anyone can join our public beta and create a new 1Password Individual account using a passkey.Choosing this passwordless sign-in method means you don’t have to memorize a 1Password account password or look after a Secret Key. All you need is your passkey, which is both convenient and secure to use.This is a major milestone for 1Password. Earlier this summer, we launched a private beta that allowed a small group of testers to try this new feature with a 1Password test account. A huge thank you to everyone who took part.Today we’re opening up the beta to everyone. A passkey is a fast and secure way of accessing everything stored in your password manager, and makes it even simpler to get things done throughout the day. We can’t wait for you to try it.The ability to unlock 1Password with a passkey is currently for new accounts only.

Personal information stored in business-owned accounts is a risk, especially when it contains vulnerabilities like weak or reused passwords.Separation of work and personal information is critical for companies – and for employees. This is precisely why every 1Password Business implementation includes access to free 1Password Families memberships for employees’ personal use.Employers never have visibility or access to anything stored in a 1Password Individual or Families account – and neither does 1Password.This separation helps foster the ideal security culture: work information in 1Password Business accounts; personal information in 1Password Individual or Families accounts. Aside from security best practices, no one wants to change jobs and lose access to their personal email because the credentials were mistakenly stored in a work account.In July, we released a feature for all 1Password accounts to help keep work and personal information separate right from the start – when you save

Passkeys have been publicly available for roughly a year. Engineered for security and phishing protection, this new form of passwordless authentication is still in the headlines — now under scrutiny.Some in the industry have questioned the longevity of passkey technology; specifically, how vulnerable they might be in a world where quantum computing is the norm. Many are questioning whether passkeys will remain a formidable force for decades or be rendered a liability faster than you can say “asymmetric cryptography.”We feel pretty strongly about passkeys around here, so this topic begs to be explored and I’m thrilled you’re joining us for the journey.

A crisis has been quietly brewing behind the shiny facade of the latest software and technology. The problem: exposed developer credentials. What started as a slow leak has now become an impossible-to-ignore flood.These leaks, stemming from the accidental exposure of API keys, security tokens, and other credentials in code, have led to a surge in recent security incidents. The technology industry has known about this issue for almost a decade, and there have been countless attempts to solve it.But a recent report by Ars Technica just how severe the issue has become. It reveals that even the most sophisticated and security-conscious engineering organizations are not immune to lapses, indicating that more work needs to be done to reverse the trend.Almost 4,000 leaked secrets discoveredThe Ars Technica story centers on a study by GitGuardian that looked at exposed secrets in just one popular open source repository used by developers.

For many people, trying to remember all their passwords is a lost cause.But clicking “forgot password” to do yet another password reset and coming up with yet another permutation of your pet’s name is a colossal waste of time – not to mention a poor approach to protecting your most important information.Password managers offer an escape from sticky notes and password spreadsheets by giving you an easy way to create, store, and use secure passwords wherever you need them.The risks of not storing your passwords securelyYou’ve likely heard about the importance of good password management – using strong passwords that you keep safe – many times over the years. While the obvious risk of improperly storing passwords means that someone other than you can get your password and into your account, the inconvenience, and more importantly, the dangers, can be more far-reaching than you’d think.

Not all hackers are bad. A subset known as white hat hackers, or ethical hackers, use their knowledge and skills for good, testing companies&#39; defenses and discovering vulnerabilities for them.And those vulnerabilities can come in many forms! From pizza delivery driver disguises to voice synthesizers to bugged e-cigarettes – some hackers go all out, no matter which side they’re on.To get an insider perspective on what it’s like to be a white hat hacker, we sat down with Jamie Woodruff on the Random but Memorable podcast.

Understanding how passkeys fit into the existing landscape of security and authentication is what our ‘versus’ series is all about. The goal of authentication is to verify that the person trying to gain access to a secret (e.g. an account) has permission to access it.In previous posts, we’ve compared passkeys to passwords, magic links, and 2FA and TOTP – now we’re going to dive into single sign-on (SSO).What is SSO?Single sign-on authentication allows users to sign in to accounts using a single identity provider rather than individual credentials for each account. This means people don’t need to remember unique credentials for every account. Instead, they just have to log in to their SSO provider.To learn more about a topic we could discuss for hours, check out our blog post on the differences between SSO and password managers, and why they make a great pair.What are passkeys?Passkeys are the cool new authentication kid on the block.

Data. Breach. We see these two words all the time in the news, on social media, and in company emails notifying us that our information might have been affected.(You may have read about one affecting a password manager recently.)Data breaches occur so frequently that it’s easy to tune out or convince yourself they’re not worth paying attention to. “Are these breaches really all that bad?” “Is anything really going to happen if I ignore a breach that might have affected one of my personal accounts?”It’s never been more important to be proactive when you hear about a data breach that affects one of your online accounts.

Account password. Secret Key. These two pieces of information have been the backbone of 1Password’s security model for years. The Secret Key in particular is what makes 1Password fundamentally different to other password managers, and why you can be confident that your data is always safe, even if someone breached our servers.Now, we’re introducing the ability to create and unlock a 1Password account with a passkey. (It’s currently in private beta, and we’re working on a version that’s ready for everyone.) This is a big and exciting change, to put it mildly, that will streamline the experience of using 1Password for many people.But it also raises the question: Does a passkey offer the same level of protection as 1Password’s existing account password and Secret Key combo?The short answer is yes. While the two solutions protect your 1Password account in slightly different ways, they both offer excellent security. So whichever option you choose, you can rest easy knowing your data is well

I remember my first hackathon. I was a junior developer at a civil engineering firm in Portland. I built a learning platform for employees to learn internal policies and procedures. It was a project that moved fast because we had a deadline - and my partner and I had so much fun.All of which is to say, this year’s 1Password Hackathon came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Everyone obviously had a lot of fun – and I’m blown away by the ingenuity of the submissions.Some of you submitted entries to secure daily workflows (in true 1Password fashion!). Some built fun games, including one to help us all strengthen our passwords. Others built integrations that extend passkeys to new integrations and frameworks.In short, we saw a whirlwind of innovation, collaboration, and groundbreaking submissions.The 1Password Hackathon prizesA quick recap on the hackathon itself.

We’ve compared passkeys to passwords and magic links, and recently explored two-factor authentication (2FA) and time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). We think this calls for a passkey and 2FA face-off, don’t you?Passkeys are the hot topic right now. This form of passwordless authentication allows you to sign in to websites and apps (that support passkey authentication) without a typical plaintext password. You authenticate with your biometric information or device passcode, and everything else happens behind the scenes, like that.Two-factor authentication requires two separate and distinct factors — it’s not merely the step of entering a TOTP that creates true 2FA. Let’s say you store your passwords digitally — in a first-rate password manager, for example. If you want the protection of true 2FA, your one-time passwords need to come from a different device than the one that holds your account passwords.So, passkeys or traditional 2FA?

Less than six months ago, artificial intelligence (AI) was largely considered to be in its infancy and primarily used for niche applications, like editing photos and keeping your home at a comfortable temperature. But that’s all changed. Since OpenAI introduced GPT-3.5 in November 2022, the possibilities of generative AI have come to dominate the popular imagination.And with good reason: ChatGPT-4 not only outperforms 90% of law students taking the bar exam, it also ranks highly for dozens of specialized tests ranging from economics to writing. Over the last few weeks, you’ve probably seen convincing images of famous people, heard catchy songs by popular artists, and read articles all completely generated by AI models.Excited by the untapped potential, many developers are jumping in and building new apps that integrate with OpenAI.

We introduced support for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) way back in the dark ages of 2015.The addition of TOTP storage lets you use 1Password as an authenticator for websites that support two-factor authentication (2FA). As 2FA became increasingly common, even required in many cases, people started to question the safety and security of using 1Password to store TOTP instead of an authenticator app that exists solely for that purpose.It remains a fairly common question — and a great one.The short answer is that storing your TOTP in 1Password is safe.

Back in March, we shared our plan to develop a privacy-preserving telemetry system that will help us build an even better 1Password. The goal was simple: to better understand how people are using 1Password, where they’re getting stuck, and which updates we should be focusing on first.Since that announcement, we’ve been testing our telemetry system internally with 1Password employees before rolling it out to anyone else. We wanted to be certain that our system, which collects small amounts of in-app usage data, could deliver valuable insights while staying true to our privacy principles.After months of development and refinement, we’re now confident we can deploy this system in a way that helps us build a better 1Password without compromising on our commitment to protect your privacy.Later this summer, you’ll see the option to participate in our telemetry system and help improve 1Password.

It’s that time of year again. Summer? Yes … but no. Vacation? No. It’s WWDC, Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference! Each year, the company uses this event to give us a sneak peak at some of the new software headed to Apple’s devices, and sometimes new devices themselves!While one new product definitely stole the show this year, there was a lot more to take in and plenty that could benefit 1Password in the near future! So let’s get into what caught our team’s attention, and how we’re thinking about some of Apple’s most important announcements.Vision ProWow, nobody — okay, almost everybody — saw this coming. But Apple’s first spatial computer exceeded our expectations. The device is packed with impressive hardware, including two micro-OLED displays with 23 million collective pixels, an M2 processor, and an all-new R1 chip.The Vision Pro could be the future of personal computing.

Pride month can be a time full of joy and is a great reminder of so much progress and so many people to be thankful for – but it’s also a reminder that the fight for 2SLGBTQIA+ rights is far from over.While our community has faced ongoing prejudice, we’ve recently seen a significant increase in hatred, discrimination, and transphobia. With uncertainty, fear, and anti-2SLGBTQIA+ legislation on the rise, it’s a particularly important time to advocate for the community, whether you’re a member or an ally.We believe that safety and security are basic human rights.

We’re always captivated by WWDC, Apple’s annual developer conference, and the announcements shared during its keynotes and various breakout sessions. This year’s conference was particularly exciting because Apple unveiled a new passkey API that will be implemented in iOS 17. The API will enable password managers like 1Password to create and use passkeys inside any native app that has added passkey support, including Safari.We’re thrilled about this announcement.If you need a quick refresher: passkeys are a new kind of login credential that entirely replaces passwords. Passkeys don’t need to be memorized, there’s no such thing as a “weak” passkey, and they can’t be stolen in a data breach. These passwordless login credentials also speed up the process of signing in to your online accounts. Research by Google shows that signing in with a password takes twice as long as a passkey login.Apple’s newly announced API will make passkeys even more useful and seamless to use on iPhones.

The term ‘passwordless’ is easy to wrap your head around (no passwords!) but is often used as an umbrella term that includes passkeys and magic links sent via email or text message.That often leads to the question: “Are passkeys and magic links the same?”The short answer is no. While they both serve as a replacement for passwords, the experience of using them, and how they work behind the scenes, is quite different.Here, we’re going to explain what passkeys and magic links are, how they differ, and why more developers are working to include both options on their websites and apps.What are passkeys?Passkeys allow you to create online accounts and sign in to them without entering a password, copying a one-time code, or clicking on a special link sent to your inbox.Instead, you just:Confirm your authenticator (in the context of passkeys, this could be your phone, tablet, or PC.)Authenticate with biometrics or your device password when prompted.Behind the scenes, passkeys use public and pr

Toward the end of last year, Passage joined 1Password to bring passwordless authentication to everyone. Now, we’re ready to introduce you to Passage by 1Password: the fastest and most secure way for developers and businesses to add passkey support to their products.According to a FIDO Alliance survey, 58% of consumers in the U.S. have abandoned purchases due to the difficulty of managing passwords. Creating a secure, frictionless sign-in experience will benefit both your customers and your business – they get a smoother login process, and you get happy customers less likely to abandon their purchases.Recent research from Google shows that users are four times more successful logging in when they authenticate through passkeys rather than passwords. This means businesses who implement passkey support could gain a competitive advantage by making it easier for customers to log in.The problem?

Artificial intelligence (AI) made a larger-than-usual splash recently when word broke of an AI-powered password cracker.

Many of the articles fail to tell the whole truth.AI absolutely can be used to crack a password.

May is a particularly special time for the AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) community. The annual celebration of AAPI Heritage Month is a time to honour the histories, cultures, and contributions of AAPI people, as well as draw attention to some of the challenges that the community faces today.It’s important to recognize that within the AAPI community, there is no one-size-fits-all experience. Each group within the community has its own unique history and culture. Here at 1Password, we’re honouring these multifaceted stories by embracing the unifying theme of “The Immigrant Experience”. Our goal is to amplify the voices and lived experiences of immigrants and children of immigrant parents. It’s a reflection of the conversations being had within our virtual walls, and beyond.With this in mind, we asked members of our AAPI community for some pieces of advice they would give to their younger selves.

We’ve used passwords to protect our private data for a very long time. But if you don’t use a password manager, it can be difficult to keep them memorized – especially if you’re using strong, unique passwords for each account.Enter passkeys.Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords. They make it simpler and more secure to sign in by allowing you to create online accounts you can log into without entering a password. All you need is a trusted device to act as your authenticator, which could be your phone, tablet, or PC. When you go to sign in to an account, your device will prompt you to authenticate using your fingerprint or face for maximum protection, or a secure PIN if biometrics aren’t available.Passwordless technology is positioned to change our lives. If we can get rid of passwords, we can also get rid of the many frustrations that come with them, from resets and phishing to failed logins and wasted time.But how do people feel about a passwordless future?

Life as a university student can get pretty hectic. You’ve got classes to attend, assignments to complete, and notes to memorize ahead of exams. On top of that, you might be juggling a part-time job, extracurricular clubs, and a busy social calendar.Setting up a password manager might not feel like the most important item on your to-do list. But it’s a small investment that can have a large positive impact on your student experience. Here, we’ll explain how 1Password will save you time, keep your accounts secure, and give you peace of mind so that you can focus on graduating with top marks.1. You’ll never forget a password for any of your university accountsMost university courses require you to create a lot of new accounts. You’ll likely have an academic email address, accounts for accessing teacher notes and resources, downloading research papers, and even accessing the school library.Remembering the password for each of these new accounts can be a real pain – especially if they’re a

Humans have used different forms of passwords to guard secrets for centuries. These days, we use strings of characters to access everything from garage doors to digital documents.The average person has over 100 passwords, all of which should be complex, random, and unique — a tall order if you don’t use a password manager like 1Password.We can add more special characters and make them absurdly long (when apps and websites allow us to) but they’re still the same passwords with the same risks. It’s time for passkeys.But what are passkeys and how do they differ from passwords? Can you use passkeys and passwords together? And are passkeys safer than traditional passwords?Let’s find out.On the surfaceWhen you create an account today, you choose a password and enter (or fill) that password when you want to sign in. You’re given access if what you enter matches what you chose when you signed up.Passkeys give the sign-up process a bit of a makeover. You use your biometrics (face or fingerprint

Over a decade ago, the sketch comedy show Portlandia tried to answer a simple question: why do hipsters put birds on everything? Teapots, tote bags, greeting cards, pillows — even toast. When in doubt, put a bird on it.It’s always fun to laugh at silly hipster trends, but UX designers also have quirky habits. Last year, the content design team at 1Password started to notice a lot of “Learn More” links across our product. A few Learn Mores are fine, but a website or app full of them creates accessibility and usability problems.To put all of this in super technical UX language: 1Password might have too many birds in it.The problemLet’s start with accessibility. Screen readers can navigate a page by jumping from link to link. If most of those links say Learn More, it’s impossible to know where they’ll take the user.Too many “Learn More” links can also make it harder to understand new features or change existing settings. Those are issues that every designer wants to avoid. Our goal is to

It’s like a technological thriller come to life. Ransomware entered the global spotlight in 2021 after a number of high-profile cases caught the media’s attention. But long before the growing threat entered the public domain, a small group of individuals started quietly helping thousands of people and businesses get their information back – without paying the ransom.Journalists Renee Dudley and Dan Golden have written about this incredible story in a book called The Ransomware Hunting Team, A Band of Misfits’ Improbable Crusade to Save the World from Cybercrime.We invited the pair onto our Random but Memorable podcast to talk about this remarkable group, and what they’ve both learned about the evolution of ransomware and cybercrime.

Devs, have you ever wished you could quickly and securely automate infrastructure secrets in your apps and development workflows without spinning up additional infrastructure?1Password Service Accounts do exactly that - and today we’re making a public beta available to all 1Password Business customers.Service Accounts are a special type of account that isn’t tied to an individual user. They can be customized to only allow access to specific vaults, and to perform certain actions on those vaults. That adds an additional layer of security and access control for organizations when accessing 1Password programmatically using the CLI. It works by configuring the CLI to use a Service Account access token for authentication, rather than requiring a specific user to authenticate manually.Service Accounts provide a convenient way to automate tasks and streamline development and deployment workflows. You can use them to load secrets into GitHub Actions, or to share and manage infrastructure secre

1Password CLI brings seamless biometric authentication to your favorite terminal-based editor, Neovim.As a full-time Neovim user, the more things I can do without leaving my terminal, the more efficient my development workflow can be. However, command line tools that require authentication can present a potentially big problem: They all have their own ways of storing credentials, often using plaintext files stored on disk. We can mitigate this and keep everything safe and secure in 1Password using 1Password CLI!What is Neovim?Neovim is a flexible text editor that runs in a terminal. It is a modal editor, which means there are several “modes” that are optimized for different types of interactions with the interface.

Here at 1Password, we’re big fans of two-factor authentication (2FA). It adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts, making it much harder for attackers to break into them.One of the strongest forms of 2FA is a FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware security key, like a YubiKey. That’s a small USB dongle that you plug in to your device, or tap via NFC, to authenticate who you are.We recently introduced the option for 1Password Business admins to enforce this type of 2FA inside their organizations. Once enabled, all team members will be required to use a physical security key when they first sign in on a new device at work.1Password is the only major password manager that gives you the choice to enforce FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware security keys in this way.We understand that the strength of your security matters.

Almost everyone understands what passwords are, and how they work. But passkeys? That’s a different story.Here at 1Password, we’re excited about passkeys, which let you create online accounts and securely sign in to them without entering a password.But we know it’s early days, and the technology hasn’t gone mainstream (yet!)Many people don’t know what a passkey is, or have heard an explanation that isn’t quite right. Here, we’re going to address some of the most common misconceptions so you can better understand how passkeys work, and use them with total confidence.Misunderstanding: Behind every passkey is a passwordMany of us use biometric authentication to unlock our devices and access our favorite online accounts. But in these scenarios, your biometrics don’t eliminate your password.Passkeys, meanwhile, act as a replacement for traditional passwords.Here’s a quick summary of how passkeys work:Passkeys leverage an API called WebAuthn.

We’re all in on passkeys, and we’re starting with 1Password.Passkeys are the modern alternative to passwords. They’re easier to use, harder to steal or crack, and built on proven, open standards designed to make logging in to your favorite apps and services faster and more secure.And they couldn’t come at a better time: credential-based attacks are only accelerating. In 2022, it was rare that a month went by without a high-profile social, identity, or security service being breached.Instead of playing whac-a-mole with passwords, why not eliminate that avenue of attack outright? That’s our mission. It’s why we’re at the forefront of passwordless advocacy, and why we’ve committed to adding full support to 1Password for generating, managing, and using passkeys.But there’s still one small gotcha, and it’s right there in our name: “one password.”For passkeys to be the way forward, it’s not enough for them to replace some of your passwords. They have to be able to replace all passwords – inc

‘Can I trust a password manager that stores my data in the cloud?&#39;It’s a good question to ask.After all, your passwords, credit cards, and other private information are precious. And when you choose a password manager with cloud-based syncing, you’re relying on someone else to watch and guard the server where your data is stored.But to answer the question: Yes, you can trust 1Password, which uses the cloud to keep your data in sync across your devices.Our systems are designed so that your data would remain safe even if an attacker gained access to our servers.Here’s how it works.What would happen if 1Password’s servers were breachedThe data you store in 1Password is always kept fully encrypted on our servers. And when we say “data”, we mean everything, including the names of your vaults, and the website URLs associated with each saved password.If an attacker somehow infiltrated one of our servers, the best they could hope to find is reams and reams of scrambled information.

Recent breaches at Uber and Slack highlight the risks of storing secrets in plaintext on disk. But that’s just the way it works, right?1. Your daily git pull is as easy as scanning your fingerprintWith our SSH Agent we’ve made your morning git pull as easy and secure as unlocking 1Password – only a scan of your fingerprint required! New keys can be generated in 1Password and synced with Git clients in seconds, then used without the private key ever leaving 1Password. You can use the SSH agent not only for authenticating Git in your daily work, but also to SSH into remote machines. Plus, when you work from other devices, you can take all your keys with you.2. Shell plugins make the magic happen with all your CLIsWhy should the magic stop at Git?

The difference between good and great software isn’t flashy features: it’s the feeling of using a tool that just works. With this in mind, our team recently decided to press pause, roll up our collective sleeves, and spend some quality time improving the fundamentals of 1Password 8.First, we collected all the feedback you’ve been sharing on our forum and on social media, in various app store reviews, and through conversations with our team. We then turned these requests into a to-do list and tasked ourselves with bringing as many of them to life as possible.Below is a sneak peek at what we’ve been working on.

Allow me to tell you a brief story — a story in which you (yes, you) are the protagonist.You signed up for 1Password, opened the app, and noticed there were items in your newly created vault. You revealed the item fields to find your Secret Key and account password.You didn’t create the item and know 1Password doesn’t have your credentials; you understandably wonder what happened — and how.Sound familiar? You’re in the right place. In this article, I answer those very legitimate questions, in order, for bonus points, and address a couple others that may be lingering in the back of your mind.Let’s start at the beginning.Here’s what happenedThe 1Password sign-up process consists of many technical and mathematical complexities. Among them is the code that triggers the creation of an Identity item and a Login item1 on your device.You’ll find the fields empty in the Identity item — they’re left for you to complete.

We love a good deep dive, so let’s talk about some of the thinking behind our approach.In this article, we’ll pull back the curtain a bit on the technical foundations of Unlock with SSO. We’ll touch on why it’s a tricky problem and how we engineered a solution that lives up to the 1Password promise – including how we ensured that no one but you can access the data in your vaults. Finally, we’ll share some notes on what Unlock with SSO means for the security of your 1Password account, and what the future holds.SSO and a decryption problemMost web services “just” need to solve authentication and authorization problems – ie. determining whether a user is who they say they are, and whether they should have access to a resource.

Always. Even in the event of a breach.We built 1Password with security and privacy as our foundation.

1Password Shell Plugins brings the security and ease of use of biometrics to every tool in your terminal.I love Touch ID. When I use it to log in to a site or authorize a purchase, authentication just kind of happens. It doesn’t feel futuristic anymore, but it does feel like the present. It’s the modern computing experience.Then I open my terminal, and I’m transported right back to the past. Why can’t devs have that modern experience?I know I’m not alone. When we introduced Touch ID support for 1Password CLI 2.0, one of the most frequent pieces of feedback we heard was: Can we have touch ID for all CLIs?So, about that.Introducing 1Password Shell PluginsWe use CLIs to perform quick actions from the comfort of our terminals and automate recurring tasks. You might use the GitLab CLI to submit your code in a merge request, so the team can review it and include it in the next release, for example.

Data breaches are on the rise, so it’s critical that companies properly protect their customers’ passwords. One of the ways that businesses do this is by hashing passwords before storing them.But what is hashing, and how does it work? And can a hashed password ever be cracked? Here, we’ll answer all of these questions and more.How does password hashing work?Hashing is a cryptographic technique invented more than 50 years ago, long before the internet and the personal computer. Today, companies use hashing to secure all kinds of sensitive data, including customer passwords.Hashing is a one-way process that protects a password by turning it into a different and seemingly random string of characters.When you choose a new password for one of your online accounts, it’s usually run through a mathematical algorithm called a hash function. The hashed password that comes out the other side is then stored on the company’s server. This helps protect it from an attacker who manages to access the p

As an Airbnb host, you have a lot to manage. Reservations, cleaning, finances – the list goes on and on. But one of the most important parts of being a host is keeping your guests, and your property, safe and secure.You might think that Airbnb security starts and stops with having a robust lock for the front door. But there’s also a digital aspect that you should be aware of. Sharing passwords securely can protect your property, and your guests, from property damage, hackers, and even uninvited people. In this post we’ll explore some ways you can digitally secure your property, and the people staying there, so everyone has a stress-free experience.Lock down access to your propertyMany Airbnb hosts are happy to meet their guests in person and physically hand over the front door key or passcode.

We have more sign-in options than ever, but keeping track of them all is becoming increasingly difficult. So we’re making it easier.Every morning, I sit down with a mug of iced coffee – shoutout to Pilot Coffee Roasters 😉 – and open my laptop. I like to throw on a Spotify playlist before I get started, so my very first action is launching Spotify in my browser. (Some good punk rock always gets me going strong early.)Occasionally I find myself logged out of Spotify, so I need to sign in. And every single time, I fail to remember which set of credentials I used to create the account more than a decade ago.Did I sign up with my Google account? Or maybe it was Apple? Or Facebook? Or an email and password?Luckily, I can avoid the guesswork simply by using 1Password in my browser to log in, because it now remembers how I signed in (or signed up), even if I used a Google, Apple, or other account to do so.No more guesswork.

My colleague, 1Password Senior Security Specialist (and all round stand-up guy) Chris Butler, and I recently chatted about a trend that’s emerged over the past few years: attempts to capitalize on cybersecurity incidents through self-promotion.Chris drew an interesting comparison: “Data breaches are similar to car accidents in some ways. And members of the security industry are like the first responders.”Just like highway traffic slows after a collision so drivers can sneak a peek at the damage, all eyes (and minds) are on cybersecurity after a breach. That period of heightened interest and awareness is the ideal time to share information, insight, and instruction.Rather than take to social media and other platforms to essentially shame the affected business and fearmonger others, we should shout about how similar attacks can be prevented.And our industry needs to lead the charge.Say it loudImagine someone could perform a basic Google search and locate a tool that scans your network an

Today, 1Password is making Typeshare publicly available as an open-source project to help Rust developers generate consistent type schema across multiple languages.With Typeshare, developers can now create FFI (foreign function interfaces) with confidence.What problem does Typeshare solve?We often write code in another language and have Rust call that code. For example, 1Password is powered by a Rust framework built from the ground up to be highly performant and secure, with a separate frontend to display the UI (user interface) on various platforms.Decoupling the display code from our business logic gives us cross-platform consistency while also letting 1Password look great on any device. But the frontends are written in a different language, so we use a foreign function interface to communicate with the frontends.But we needed to ensure the data we gave to the frontend was understood correctly - if the data types between the languages weren’t in sync, it would result in a host of pro

SIM swapping, also known as SIM jacking, is a technique used by attackers to gain access to a person’s phone number and, ultimately, their two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.A fraudster will impersonate a target while calling their mobile service provider and ask for the target’s phone number to be ported to a new SIM card. The attacker will then check whether they can use the phone number to intercept any SMS-based 2FA codes.How does SIM swapping work?SIM swapping is a growing problem that leverages social engineering.Criminals will call their target’s mobile service provider and recount a fake but believable story for their SIM swap request. For example, they might say: “I lost my phone at a music festival and need help transferring my number to a new SIM card.”The mobile service provider will likely ask some security questions to verify the caller’s identity. However, criminals are smart and will prepare for these questions by researching their target beforehand. They’ll root thr

When a data breach appears in the news (which has happened a lot recently), many of us picture a hacker in a black hoodie, trawling through reams of code on a custom-built PC. We often imagine them finding a single mistake – a zero that should be a one, or vice versa – that lets them slip through a company’s defenses.After all, that’s how hacking is usually portrayed in movies and TV shows.But re-read the latest news reports and you’ll notice that most data breaches can be traced back to a single cause: social engineering. Increasingly, hackers are exploiting human psychology, rather than technical vulnerabilities, to access company accounts, tools, and databases.The success of these attacks hinges on how persuasive the hacker can be – or how well they can imitate someone trustworthy – rather than their knowledge of a particular programming language.It’s a timely reminder that cybersecurity is always changing, and the best way to protect a company is by focusing on the people who work

Every single day we use passwords to sign in to our online accounts. But that doesn’t mean they’re a perfect solution.If you don’t have a password manager, it’s challenging to create and remember hundreds of strong passwords. Many people give up and use the same password for everything, or a few predictable passwords, which makes it easier for cybercriminals to hijack their accounts.Enter passkeys.

Have you ever heard the cybersecurity term “dictionary attack”, and wondered what it means? You’re not alone. Here, we’ll break down what a dictionary attack is, and explain what steps you should take to protect yourself from this threat.What is a dictionary attack?A dictionary attack is a type of brute-force hacking method that relies on specific lists (i.e. “dictionaries”) of words or phrases the attacker thinks will have the highest chance of success. Unlike a typical brute-force attack, which tries every possible password combination (e.g. “AAA”, “AAB”, “AAC”, and so forth), a dictionary attack is much more focused and efficient.The list could include words from a dictionary, passwords that have leaked in the past, or common regional references or phrases, like a Florida resident using“Dolphinsfan305”. They then use automated programs to try combinations of possible usernames and passwords until they’re able to break into the account.While hackers can use dictionary attacks directl

1Password is serious about securing developers&#39; workflows. That’s why we’ve built and continue to improve upon 1Password Developer Tools.Today we’re talking to developer and friend of 1Password Soner Sayakci, who is both a Jetbrains and 1Password user. Just a few weeks ago, Sayakci released a fantastic integration that enables developers to make use of 1Password vaults, secret references, and more within the Jetbrains integrated development environment (IDE).By automating tedious tasks, 1Password Developer Tools speeds up development workflows while eliminating the potential for human error. We’ve automated SSH key management. We’ve added biometric unlock to Git authentication and other SSH workflows to simplify secrets management in the terminal. We also aim to bring 1Password’s security model and ease of use to the tools developers use every day.

SSH key management practices reflect the environment in which they were first introduced. The 1Password SSH agent is a big step toward aligning practices with the modern world.Earlier this year, we introduced the 1Password SSH agent as part of our commitment to bring developers the kinds of things developers want to see. Today, I’ll discuss a re-evaluation of the security properties and habits some of us old-timers may have regarding SSH keys, and which of those habits are outdated.The short version is that SSH was originally a drop-in replacement for rsh (remote shell) and rlogin, which were centered around one machine trusting another machine, or one account on a machine trusting an account on another machine. SSH private keys were associated not just with individuals, but individual accounts on particular hosts.Some of us old-timers need to adjust how we think about SSH keys.SSH key management tools and conventions grew out of that environment.

Encryption is an essential step in cybersecurity that protects confidential information by turning it into scrambled gibberish. This ensures attackers can’t understand it, and only trusted individuals can make it understandable again.There are different types of encryption, with different security and access levels. There are two main types of encryption:Symmetric, which uses a single key for encryption and decryption.Asymmetric, which relies on pairs of connected keys called a public key and private key. This means a different key is used for the encryption and decryption processes.Asymmetric or public-key cryptography is an increasingly popular method used in modern technology. Here, we’ll explain how public and private key pairs work, and why they’ve become such a widely used form of encryption.What are encryption keys?First, let’s establish what a “key” is. In cryptography, it’s a tool that can turn readable data into something indecipherable. It’s not, as it may sound like, a plot

You’ve probably watched at least one movie or TV show where a hacker sneaks into someone’s house, finds a computer, and then guesses the password on the first try. They then declare, “I’m in!” before downloading reams of sensitive data.You may have asked yourself, “Is this really how criminals figure out people’s passwords?” The short answer is no. But hackers do have some tried-and-tested ways to obtain passwords. In fact, almost half of all data breaches involve stolen credentials.Here, we’ll explain the most common techniques hackers use, and what you can do to protect yourself.1. Social engineering and phishingSocial engineering is a form of manipulation. Attackers trick people into sharing their passwords, payment details, or other sensitive information by posing as someone trustworthy or authoritative. Criminals will use this tactic over the phone, in an email or text message, or a DM on social media – anywhere that you could feasibly be contacted by the person or company they’re

For many workers, accessing the tools required to do their jobs is a hassle. This ‘login fatigue’ could be putting your business at risk as employees find less secure workarounds to complete tasks, or, in some cases, give up on a task altogether.To better understand login fatigue and the risks it poses, 1Password surveyed 2,000 adults in Canada and the U.S. These were all full-time employees at companies with more than 250 workers, and who primarily used a computer to do their job. We expected login fatigue to be a source of frustration. What we found is an escalating and far more complex problem, with wide-ranging effects on worker productivity, security, and mental health.Key findingsFatigue and frustration: Nearly half of employees (44%) say that the process of logging in and out at work harms their mood or reduces productivity.Incomplete work product: 26% of workers have given up on doing something at work to avoid the hassle of logging in.Missing meetings: 62% of employees miss pa

Much of online education directed at students focuses on internet safety and privacy – and rightfully so. But it’s important that equal attention be directed towards teaching the next generation how to keep their accounts and identities safe online.That starts with helping them know how to spot the most common scams and threats, and sharing what preventative measures they can use to reduce their risk.The first week of school is the perfect time to introduce students to online security. As they get acquainted with school devices and set up new accounts it’s a great time to talk about risks and how they can be proactive about avoiding them. But security should be an ongoing conversation.

A well-thought-out incident response plan is no longer recommended – it’s critical. With the rate that cyber attacks are increasing – putting customer privacy at risk and forcing some businesses to close – it’s never been more important to educate your team on the risks, and help prepare your organization for the worst case scenario.Most businesses don’t have a plan in place for when a security breach occurs. That’s a costly oversight given that, according to the same research, the majority of large U.S. businesses have experienced some form of cyber attack before. An effective incident response plan brings people, processes, and technology together to reduce the chances of a breach, and minimize the damage of any that do occur. No matter what type of business you operate, putting this plan in place is critical to creating a strong, proactive cybersecurity strategy.1Password is excited to share two new resources to help with navigating the modern threats that businesses face.

So 1Password CEO Jeff Shiner just committed code to one of my GitHub repositories. That’s strange. While he’s a developer at heart, I don’t think he gets much time to code these days. What’s going on here?As you might have guessed, this didn’t actually come from Jeff Shiner. In fact, anyone can spoof a Git committer or author name with just a few terminal commands and pretend to be someone else:$ git config user.email &quot;jeff.shiner@1password.com&quot;$ git commit -m “Add tractor autopilot mode.”This can make for a fun prank but is also a security liability. If you don’t know who is pushing code to your repositories, how will you know if your codebase is being hijacked by someone pretending to be a coworker?The answer is, you won’t know who is actually committing code unless your team signs their commits. This means using a cryptographic key pair to add a digital signature to each commit that verifies your identity. Once you sign, GitHub adds a handy “verified” badge to each commit. Goodbye f

In a perfect world, software developers would not only have an innate understanding of security but be able to create bulletproof code from the get-go.I have been working across the software development lifecycle for over 25 years, so I can say with confidence that we don’t live in a perfect world.In 2021, a survey of DevOps and IT professionals revealed that roughly 80% of companies admit to not managing their infrastructure secrets well. With the myriad of secrets that software teams manage, it becomes a herculean task to keep track of all of those secrets at a granular level.As a result, developers often store secrets in plaintext files and other formats to make them easily accessible – but if they’re accessible to devs, they’re also accessible to attackers. Unattended secrets such as database credentials and API keys open a security backdoor, and the payoffs for bad actors are bigger than ever.

If you’ve spent a lot of time on the internet, you’ve probably heard the term “doxing” before.

Here, we’re going to explain what doxing is, how it works, and how you can protect your sensitive data.What does doxing mean?Doxing is an abbreviated form of “dropping dox”, an old revenge tactic created by the hacking community in the 1990s. Hackers would find and release documents – known as “dox” or docs – about previously-anonymous rivals, revealing their true identities and exposing them to authorities who might have been trying to track them down.Doxing has since evolved into a more mainstream type of online harassment. It usually involves uncovering and compiling someone’s personal information without their knowledge or permission — such as their real name, address, job, or phone number — and sharing it publicly on the inte

You’ll learn about the journeys that each person took to 1Password, as well as their their current role and day-to-day responsibilities.Today, we’re chatting with Mark-Shane Scale, Team Lead for Customer Support at 1Password!Why did you join 1Password, and how did you end up here?In February 2019, I attended a job fair at a small Canadian city mall. Armed with my resume and cover letter, I was set on talking to three businesses, and I wanted one to be a technology company. That day, I met a hiring manager and one of the founders of 1Password.I knew nothing about 1Password until I saw t

Sometimes I forget to marvel at what we, as an industry, have built in the past 30 years.I have this little device in my pocket, and a slightly larger version on my nightstand. With either one, I can video chat with a friend in the UK, access my medical records, or check in for a vet appointment. I can track my workouts or reserve a table at my favorite restaurant.I can buy movie tickets, concert tickets, and plane tickets. I can watch videos uploaded by creators from around the globe and learn how to do almost anything. Heck, I can even pair up a controller and play some pretty awesome games. All from the device in my pocket.Unless I was tethered to my desk, I couldn’t do any of that when our founders – Dave, Sara, Roustem, and Natalia – built the first version of 1Password in 2006. The smartphone and tablet as we know them didn’t yet exist.But today, when I pull out my phone or grab my iPad, a world of possibilities opens to me.That’s the world for which we built 1Password 8.

Duke University is one of the most storied and prestigious learning institutions in the United States. Duke and its healthcare arm, Duke University Health System, are home to tens of thousands of students and employees.With so many coming and going from the Duke campus every day – and accessing Duke’s many state-of-the-art services within its digital network – security is a top priority for Duke’s Office of Information Technology (OIT). And like any IT department head, IT Security Office senior manager Nick Tripp knows that password security is the backbone of a sound security approach.“Password managers make life easier, more secure. We’re all aware that the main problem with passwords is it’s hard for users to create strong passwords,” Tripp says.The trick, though, is getting everyone to use their password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Having adopted a 1Password competitor years ago, many on campus simply didn’t use it. And even those that did struggled to integrate

I own a lot of domains, and keeping track of where all of them are pointing can be more than a little tricky. I found a tool that helps me keep everything in sync with a single point of truth.After mixing in the 1Password command-line tool, I had everything I need to keep my domains up to date and pointing where I want them, without having to worry about my credentials being stored unsafely.For creatives and online professionals, we’ve all been there. We think of an idea or concept and say: “Oh, that’s a good domain name”, click, repeat. Eventually, you end up with your domain registrar looking a little something like this.Not only do I have it bad here, I’ve got three other name registrars chock full with domains between them. I’ve been managing them mostly by moving them into a single nameserver provider, but for various reasons, I keep a few on a separate nameserver provider.I’m constantly seeking a better way of managing them and a few weeks ago, a friend of mine pointed me in the

Have you ever seen someone plug a USB dongle into their device in order to sign in to something? Or worked for a company that required you to use one whenever you unlocked your laptop, or logged in to an important account?These authenticators are called hardware security keys. Some people will also refer to them as just security keys, or two-factor security keys.Here, we’ll break down what these dongles are and how they make it harder for criminals to gain access to your devices and accounts.What is a hardware security key?A hardware security key is a way to prove that you or someone you trust – and not a criminal – is trying to access or sign in to something. They’re known as a “possession factor” because they prove you physically own something used to authenticate your account.Security keys are a form of second or multi-factor authentication (MFA). This means that when you log in with your normal credentials – which could be a four-digit pin code on your phone, or a username and pass

Addresses, credit card numbers, software licenses, and more. There’s a lot you need to keep track of to manage your online world.Modern life can be messy, and it means we’re all likely to make a mistake at some point.You might use 1Password to update a weak password, only to realize you still need the old one for a different website. Or you accidentally opened the wrong item in 1Password and replaced a set of important security questions and answers. Maybe a family member updated the password to your streaming service but forgot to click save, and now you still need the old login. Accidents happen!In situations like these, it’s easy to think, “Uh oh, what now?”Don’t panic – you haven’t lost access to any of your favorite accounts. And you won’t have to go through the tedious process of resetting the password. 1Password remembers the history of every item saved in your vaults.

At 2022’s AGConf (1Password’s annual employee conference), every employee received a goodie box to celebrate the event and the company’s successes over the past year. Our theme this year was “space”, so the goodie box included a kit for a Lego rocket ship (very appropriate considering our own CEO is a Lego aficionado).Building the spaceship brought me back to when I was younger and played endlessly with those little bricks.For me, though, it wasn’t so much about building the specific items in a kit. Sure, I absolutely loved putting together the houses and planes and cars, but what I was most fascinated by was how I could use tiny bricks to expand my creation and build anything I could dream up. The possibilities were endless, my imagination ran wild, and sometimes – usually through through dumb luck – I built something way cooler than what the kit offered in the first place.Late last year, I started exploring the React-based documentation framework Docusaurus, and spent a good chunk of

With so many ways to sign in to apps and services, there’s even more to keep track of. That’s why we’re introducing the ability to save and fill new kinds of logins in 1Password.Signing in to websites used to be as easy as filling in a username and a password. But lately, it’s started to feel more like a multiple choice exam. So many of us stare at login screens and wonder if we need to:a) “sign in with Google”“Sign in with…” buttons are becoming more popular, and it’s easy to see why. They let you reuse an account you already have, instead of creating a new one with a unique password for every site.But as convenient as these options are, they’re not hassle-free. They still involve too many steps, clicks, and, yes – passwords. And it’s so easy to get lost in the sea of choices and forget which account or provider you used for which website.No password? No problem.When we announced our vision of the future, we introduced the concept of Universal Sign On. What that means to us is that lo

In writing software, we’re used to embedding secrets and other configurable values right in the codebase. They might be Stripe keys to power your online shop, webhooks for a custom Slack bot, a Docker username and password for a CI config, AWS credentials, or an API token and host to set up 1Password Connect.Secrets are used everywhere in our code. Sometimes, though, we forget when we’ve been using real secrets in our work. Maybe there’s a leftover token you dropped in to build that one feature, or maybe you didn’t delete the .env file you set up to test drive the app. Now you’ve got to rotate your secrets because you accidentally committed and pushed sensitive values for the whole world to see.

If you don’t work in IT or security, there’s no need to fret about every detail of every online danger. Nevertheless, it’s worth having awareness of the strategies and techniques that criminals are using to achieve their goals online.In this explainer, we’ll be breaking down DDoS attacks to help you understand the basics and how you can be affected.What is a distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack?A DDoS attack is a method that criminals use to overwhelm an online service, like a website, by bombarding it with fake internet traffic from multiple different locations. The sheer amount of traffic prevents real users from accessing the targeted sites or online services.Am I at risk of a DDoS Attack?The average person isn’t likely to be on the receiving end of a DDoS attack. However, you could be one of the users unable to access an online service because of one, or even own one of the devices being used to perpetuate an attack.

Two decades ago, the web was a casual escape dominated by message boards, AOL Instant Messenger, and Homestar Runner. Only some people used it for work. Fast forward 20 years, and countless jobs require that you use the internet in some way. This has made it easier than ever to take a quick break, open a new tab, and do some personal surfing – blurring the line between work and leisure.While on the clock, it’s crucial that you and your employees use the internet wisely. Everyone needs a break, and watching the occasional funny video can actually be a healthy habit. But that doesn’t mean you can be careless, either. Everyone on your team should know how to browse wisely, securely, and respectfully while working or using company devices. Some basic online awareness can also be one of the most effective plays in small business security, while keeping your team mindful participants in a web-friendly workplace.We be surfin’Have you ever paused work to read an online movie review?

When we develop software, it’s common practice for engineers to require system configuration in order to run a program. We specify instructions on how to set up your own local environment in a .env.example file or README.md file.For every project that we work on and for every configuration change of those projects, we need to do manual work to keep our local environments up to date so they continue to work. Often, this is a struggle. Also, aren’t we all sick of hearing “it works on my machine”?Why are we creating and maintaining this configuration manually? The reason: our required configuration contains sensitive values that should be kept secret. For this reason, the environment file that’s consumed by our applications is added to the .gitignore file, in order to avoid it being synced to source control.To date, there is no common practice to collaborate on and share these sensitive values securely and effectively.

Which is why we created a number of programs to champion equity and diversity on an ongoing basis at 1Password.Alongside my colleagues and team this month, I’m taking the step to make my pronouns more visible across my social channels as well as internally across Slack and Zoom.

It’s been more than a year since the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S hit store shelves. These releases, combined with the ongoing pandemic, have led to an unprecedented number of people turning to gaming to spend their free time. But with that increase comes more interest from scammers hoping to take advantage of unsuspecting customers.People spent more than $60.4 billion on video games in the U.S. last year – an 8% increase over 2020. The first lockdown saw a 54% increase in gaming-related phishing attacks. But it’s not just the money that makes gaming attractive to criminals – it’s also the wide variety of information that can be stolen and exchanged for real-world dollars.Criminals who target gaming can steal in-game currency, in-game loot, or even sell entire accounts. Some convert game items like skins or rare items to cash on Ebay, or use stolen currency to purchase and sell expensive items.That’s why it’s more important than ever to secure your game accounts.Level

As microtransactions in gaming increase and more money is exchanged online, it’s become more important than ever to secure your financial and personal information.In 2021, there was an 8 percent increase in spending on video games, including subscriptions and in-game purchases across mobile, console, and PCs. That means people spent over $60.4 billion on video games in the U.S. last year. This growth is contributing to an uptick in scams looking to take advantage of gamers&#39; poorly protected financial information.The cost of convenienceTo avoid interrupting the gaming experience, game makers have made it easy to save payment details.

It’s a tough time for small business owners and their employees. Surging operational costs and supply chain issues are colliding with a rate of inflation that’s limiting how much consumers are willing and able to spend. And as the pandemic continues, there could be more legal and economic hurdles on the way. Startups and other small businesses are fighting to keep their doors open, or to open them in the first place.If your team is struggling, cybersecurity may not seem like the highest priority. But investing in the right tools and processes is critical to keep employees productive and your business protected. Any upfront costs are nothing when compared to the potential price of a data breach. Most businesses that are attacked don’t get a second chance to improve their defenses, either.In the small business comeback story, secure-minded habits like better password management will be a critical plot point.

In case of emergency – that is, forgetting your login for 1Password, or someone else needing to get in – the 1Password Emergency Kit can truly save the day. This short and sweet document keeps all the necessary details for getting into your account in one place. But you shouldn’t need to break glass to retrieve it (which is a huge pain to clean up, not to mention dangerous). Here’s how to keep your Emergency Kit both safe and accessible.What is the Emergency KitWe’re not talking about a flashlight and a pocket knife. The 1Password Emergency Kit is a simple document that you should know about and look after if you use 1Password to store your passwords and other sensitive details or documents.Here’s why: To best protect your secrets, every item you save in 1Password is fully encrypted.

1Password for SSH was shared with the world last month. I have been using it since it was available for internal beta. I knew it would improve my endpoint security. I didn’t expect it to change the way I generated, stored and used SSH keys the way I work.Let me take a step back.The first time I used SSH, I connected my college’s global lab linux server with PuTTY. I used a username and password to authenticate and never really appreciated the magic that made it all work. It was a step away from the familiar world of FTP and RDP.SSH later became an integral part of my developer experience when my job switched from Subversion to Git. I was a Jr. Developer at the time and struggled to generate an SSH key. Another developer on the team generated an RSA key pair for me and shared it on a thumb drive. It was some years later before I realized this was less than ideal.Eventually, I fell into a routine. I would get a new laptop, generate a private key – sometimes I would even use a passphrase

When these moments come up, typing in a password liken1}C9_X&gt;V-^A5hc]z8!uCXB]bc3jTRWx+Csis not a fun experience, regardless of how secure it may be.So what’s the answer? Enter Memorable Passwords (also known as passphrases). These are created by combining a handful of real but unrelated words. A passphrase could beball-orange-moon-car-pilot, for instance. As long as each word is random, the complete passphrase can be just as difficult for an attacker to crack as a password that contains characters, letters, and symbols.With Memorable Passwords, 1Password can generate passwords that, while still distinctive and random, are easier to remember. Memorizing and typing something likestern-patron-mailmen-degreaseis a practical way to maint

Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at 1Password, recently interviewed Jeremiah Peschka, staff software developer at Stack Overflow, on our Random But Memorable podcast.Stack Overflow is an extensive online community where you can get answers to all your technical questions. Michael and Jeremiah dive into why building communities for developers is so important and how code is reshaping our world. Check out the highlights below, or listen to the full interview.Michael Fey: I’m sure most of our listeners are aware of what Stack Overflow is and have taken code snippets and shipped it out to production systems, but for those who might not know, can you give us a quick overview?Jeremiah Peschka: Stack Overflow is the finest repository of copy and paste snippets you can find. It’s where users can ask questions and get answers to questions. We have a lot of different sites where there are different communities – like sci-fi, cooking, and woodworking – where you can focus on more than just general

One of the many values of 1Password is that we make it faster and easier to use strong, unique passwords everywhere online. That’s great if you already have a good handle on why password strength matters for online security. But we know that not everyone does.If you’re ever in a position of needing to explain the benefits of using a password manager – whether to a friend, family member, boss, or colleague – this post is for you. We hope this helps you share the value of stronger online security.Online threats are on the riseA great place to start is with the problem a password manager solves. We try not to be scaremongers, but at the same time, everyone should know that the internet can be risky to use. For all that it adds to our everyday lives, there are also innumerable threats in the shape of criminals, hackers, and con artists who want access to your personal information. Stealing passwords and logins is fundamental to their work.Websites and the companies that operate them are fr

Very few people can memorize all of their passwords – especially if they’re using unique ones for each account. Many solve this problem by embracing a password manager like 1Password, while others turn to pen and paper. The latter could be a tiny notebook, a whiteboard on their office wall, or an array of sticky notes attached to their PC monitor.We hear two questions a lot: Is it safe to record your passwords in an analog format? And, what are the benefits of switching to a password manager?The short answer to the first question is … yes, pen and paper can be a secure way to manage your passwords. But that doesn’t mean it’s the best way to protect your accounts and stay safe online. Read on to learn why.Is it really that bad if I write down my passwords?Grabbing a pen and writing down your passwords isn’t necessarily insecure. It depends on where you keep the object (your notebook, whiteboard, etc.) that contains your passwords, and the likelihood that a criminal will stumble upon it.

We are lifting the Early Access curtain on our brand new iOS app – and it is gorgeous.I’ve written a whole post about why you’ll love this update and why you should check it out, but maybe you don’t need that.

From smartphones to smart fridges, the Internet of Things is producing more and more devices that are meant to be connected to a Wi-Fi network. The average household was expected to own 50 connected devices in 2021, up from just 10 devices the year before. With so many gadgets living on your home network, it’s never been more important to ramp up your Wi-Fi security.The basics of home Wi-Fi securityMany of the steps required to fortify your home network involve adjusting some settings. Every router and Internet Service Provider (ISP) will have some variation in the way you can access and change these settings, but you should be able to easily find the information you need on your ISP’s website. If you can’t find the instructions online, contact your ISP directly or reach out to the manufacturer of your router.1.

From restaurant menus to sporting tickets, using a QR code has become a regular part of life for many. They’ve been widely used in some countries for years, and during the pandemic they finally hit mass adoption in North America and the UK.But as QR codes grow in popularity, so do the security risks. It’s important to understand these risks and what you can do to avoid them, so you’re prepared the next time you encounter one in the wild.Why QR codes are on the riseQR codes were first invented in 1994 for tracking automotive parts during manufacturing, and slowly began to spread into parts of everyday life. In China, contactless payments driven by QR codes have been the norm for a long time, with many businesses not even accepting credit cards or cash. However, the QR code initially struggled to gain traction in the Western market.But when the pandemic hit in 2020, there was a clear benefit to touchless technology.

As a consumer, I’m a bit spoiled. When I pick up my phone to check my messages in the morning, I scan my fingerprint to get instant access to everything I’ve added to my homescreen. It’s my very own personalized magic portal to all my stuff.Even the apps themselves are (with some exceptions) built to delight.That’s not the case for most tools that developers use every day. Once you leave the consumer ecosystem and get to work in a terminal or an IDE, the experience changes. Because of our technical know-how, we think we need complexity. But we’re here to build the software that powers the world, not necessarily to remember an arcane command and copy access keys a million times every day.When you need to authenticate in your terminal or IDE, why can’t you just use your fingerprint, watch, or face like we can do today in most consumer products?There’s nothing I want more than to extend the magic that we take for granted as consumers to developers.

There are countless reasons why you might want to keep the websites you’re visiting a secret. For example, you could be planning a surprise vacation for your best friend, seeking out information that’s meant to be banned in your country, or simply trying to minimize what advertisers know about you.In these situations, many people turn on their web browser’s built-in private browsing or incognito mode. Why? Because the names of these features suggest they’ll turn you into a temporary ghost that can’t be tracked by any person, employer, advertiser, or government.But they don’t work like that.Private browsing and incognito modes can be useful, but they don’t hide your activity from everyone. If you want to take back control of your privacy, it’s important to know what these modes conceal, and who they conceal it from. Once you know their limitations, you can turn them on at a time that makes the most sense for you, and take other precautions to increase your privacy when necessary.What pr

Responsible for keeping your business secure? We know it can feel like a daunting task. After all, the average business has multiple employees using different devices with varying amounts of technological expertise. A single team member might use just one app to stay productive, while another may use 1,000. And they could work in a company-owned location, like an office, or hundreds of places around the world, including their own home.That’s a lot to consider.If cybersecurity is leaving you tired, anxious or overwhelmed, you’re not alone. In our first State of Access Report, 84% of security professionals said they were currently feeling burned out.The truth is there’s no quick fix that will make cybersecurity an easy or endlessly relaxing problem.

Getting a password manager is the ultimate minimalist move – after all, reducing the number of passwords you need to remember down to one is pretty significant. When we’re talking about digital minimalism we’re referring to the idea of simplifying your digital life to help you focus on the things that are truly important to you. A password manager is an important tool in any digital minimalist’s life and can help you achieve that organizational, zen-like happiness.Why digital minimalism is importantDigital minimalism is about intentionally choosing the technology we use in order to improve our lives. This is important from both a security standpoint and a well-being standpoint. Security-wise, using a password manager means you can use strong, unique passwords for every account. 1Password also points out websites where you can enable 2FA, and highlights websites where a breach has occurred advising you to update your password on that site.From a well-being standpoint, not having to worr

Creating and remembering strong, unique passwords can be a challenge, and resetting them when you forget can be annoying and time-consuming. But it doesn’t have to be this way. If you adopt a password manager like 1Password, you can instantly generate and safely store all your passwords in one place.The problem with passwordsWith nearly everything online requiring an account these days, password security has never been more important. You can’t protect every account with your pet’s name or your mom’s birthday and expect them to remain safe. Instead, you need to use strong, unique passwords. But if you don’t have a system for remembering them, it’s easy to fall into a frustrating cycle of creating, forgetting, and constantly resetting them.Security breaches and password theft are on the rise, so it’s no surprise that many sites are demanding longer, more complex passwords with upper and lower case letters, and at least one number and special character. They’re tougher for cybercriminals

The trusty webcam used to be a “nice to have” for the occasional job interview, virtual hangout, or simple YouTube recording. But that all changed when the pandemic started. In just a few months it became a daily tool for people around the world, from fully remote businesses to families and friends kept apart in lockdown.Webcams now play such a large role in our lives that it can be easy to forget their potential risks. Many people don’t realize that cybercriminals can exploit laptop webcams, phone cameras, and standalone webcams if they’re used incorrectly. The exploding popularity of video calls and personal livestreams also means that more cameras are in use at any given time, creating more opportunities for attackers.Webcam usage is only going to rise as more of us work remotely, connect with loved ones on platforms like Zoom, and experiment with apps like Twitch and Instagram Live.

You power on your computer and open your inbox, ready for another day at work. But instead of some unread emails, you see a login screen with an all-too-familiar message: it’s time to update your password. And it can’t just be any password. It needs to be one you haven’t used before, and it must include a number… and a special character… and be 8 characters long…Sound familiar? Many companies require their employees to change their password every 90 days. It’s an inconvenient policy which leads people to ask: Is it really necessary?The short answer is no. Frequent password changes may have been a good idea in years gone by, but they’re not necessary today. Read on to learn why.The thinking behind mandatory password changesThe idea behind forced password expiration is simple. If your credentials are always changing, it’s harder for an attacker to know what they are at any given time. For example, a cybercriminal might stumble upon a list of leaked passwords.

Conversations about consumer data privacy grow louder each year, with the news headlines to match. Trust in the technology sector is now at an all-time low and customers are increasingly concerned about the privacy of their personal information. It’s become a serious topic that all business owners need to follow, not just security specialists and tech bloggers.For small businesses, there’s some good news: Customers are more likely to trust you than the larger brands, according to a 2021 study by the Kearny Consumer Institute. But remember that trust needs to be earned. As more data is collected, both inside and outside of tech, privacy efforts are now critical – both ethically and legally. No matter your size, it’s never been more important to treat personal data with the respect it deserves.

A robotic voicemail asking for your information? Most of us have.

Single sign-on, or SSO, is a valuable addition to your enterprise security arsenal. It doesn’t protect against every threat, but it can reduce your attack surface, lower IT costs, and provide a better login experience for your employees.What is SSO?Without single sign-on, employees typically create a unique login for each site and service they use at work. With SSO, employees sign onto their SSO platform with a single, strongly vetted identity. That single identity then gives them access to all the services within the SSO framework.Each SSO provider works a bit differently, but the basics are the same. Let’s use Okta – a leader in enterprise SSO – as an example. Once deployed, employees can log into Okta to see a dashboard that lists all of the services they can access. They simply click the site or web app they want to launch from the list, and Okta launches the URL and logs them in automatically using SSO.That’s a very different experience from opening each site and entering login in

The journey to becoming a developer has many paths. The most traditional is through attending a university and obtaining a computer science degree. However, many in the industry arrive via a different route.In particular, those who come from traditionally underrepresented groups often find themselves entering this space later in life and with vastly different experiences than those from university.But it can be tricky to enter the profession from an unconventional route because so many learning and training opportunities are restricted to university students. So where does this leave those who found their way into tech outside of the traditional path?Introducing The Collab LabLuckily there are organizations like The Collab Lab that are trying to help fill in this gap.

Millions of workers are leaving their jobs after enduring stay-at-home lockdowns and reflecting on what they need to be truly happy and healthy. While the ‘Great Resignation’ could have a positive impact on society, it also represents a security risk for businesses of all sizes.Because if your company doesn’t keep tabs on its rapidly changing workforce, it could accidentally grant someone the wrong access and, in the worst-case scenario, give cybercriminals access to critical data.To safely navigate the Great Resignation, you need to focus on two key areas: provisioning and device management.Why provisioning matters“Provisioning” can refer to many aspects of IT infrastructure, but here we’re talking about access to important files, accounts, and services.

Business security is often associated with larger companies where employees spend most of their time in front of computers. This stereotype can lead small business owners – especially ones outside the tech industry – to think they’ll never be targeted by hackers and don’t need to invest in security. It’s a mistake that cybercriminals are exploiting. Even without a traditional office environment or complex IT infrastructure, your growing business needs to take security seriously.If your team uses the web in any capacity, it’s critical they protect their accounts with strong, unique passwords. Stolen logins are at the heart of most modern attacks. But there are other vulnerabilities and threats to be aware of, some which might be specific to your industry or company structure.

Creativity can be fickle. One day, your brain is full of bright ideas you’re keen to jot down, develop, and share with others. The next day, you have nothing. Zilch. Not even a flicker of an idea. You suddenly feel like a world-class restaurant that’s run out of ingredients.A key element of creativity is finding the odd jolt of inspiration. But discovering that spark can be tricky if you work from home. You don’t have a normal commute, which for many is a chance to let your mind wander and experience random but inspirational moments. Similarly, you’re not working in a busy office that’s full of sights, sounds, and smells to draw from.But that doesn’t mean you can’t be just as creative while working remotely – you just need to make a conscious effort to surround yourself with sources of inspiration. These can be physical objects, online communities, or activities that encourage you to hit pause on work, turn off your devices, and clear your head.Real-world serendipityRecreate the commut

Staying secure at work doesn’t need to be complicated. Minimize stress and avoid burnout by following these simple cybersecurity tips.How cybersecurity and burnout are relatedNo-one wants to feel burned out at work. Battling physical or emotional exhaustion can impact your health, happiness, and any sense of professional fulfillment. That in turn can affect your productivity and the likelihood you’ll make an honest mistake that puts your company’s data at risk.Our first State of Access study found that burned-out employees are 37% more likely than other workers to have poor practices when setting up work-related passwords.While there are many factors that can lead to burnout, staying secure doesn’t need to be one of them. Follow these 15 cybersecurity tips to protect yourself and your company from the vast majority of attacks:Passwords1.

In 2020, millions of businesses were thrust into remote work. What started as necessity has revealed lasting benefits for both employers and employees, though. The model improved productivity and employee morale, while lowering operational costs. Between these benefits and the continued priority of worker safety, many startups are launching with a remote or hybrid approach from the outset.New businesses may find it easier to adopt this style of work because they don’t have a team that’s used to being in the office together, or to following processes that were never designed with a remote model in mind. This provides an advantage for cybersecurity, as well.With employees working from anywhere, security education and involvement are more crucial than ever. A culture of security can be a unifying force that makes safe online habits a source of pride, rather than a chore.

As a startup, you might have branded swag well before a cybersecurity strategy. And it’s not hard to understand why. Printing stickers is easy. Knowing where to start with security – the who, what, how, and why – can feel a bit more daunting. But it doesn’t have to, and is far more important to your company’s future.Cybersecurity risks are growing by the day, especially for startups. Almost half of smaller businesses reported cybersecurity breaches or attacks over the last year, up from less than a third in the previous year. It’s an epidemic that forces 60 percent of affected businesses to close within 6 months.Part of the problem is a lack of resources – small companies are often stretched thin, and IT hires aren’t always seen as a priority early on. But the larger issue is a lack of awareness. Startups often don’t know the extent of risks they face, their particular vulnerabilities, or that solutions don’t need to be expensive or complicated.If you’re leading a startup, and have a s

If you feel like you can’t go a week without hearing about yet another data breach on the news, you’re not experiencing déjà vu. Data breaches are on the rise, and massive organizations like Solar Winds and Facebook aren’t the only ones vulnerable to attack.From businesses to individuals, data breaches can affect anyone. For example, small and medium sized-businesses are now targeted by 70% of cyber attacks, and 58% of breaches involve personal data.It might seem like a battle you just can’t win, but there are ways to minimize your risk and stay secure online. We’ll walk you through a simple data breach definition, how to protect yourself from a data breach, hacking and social engineering attacks, and what you need to do if your data is ever compromised.What is hacking?People often confuse the words “hack” and “breach” or use them interchangeably.

Many companies feel like they’ve successfully pivoted to remote and hybrid work. Team members have learned the tools and processes required to be successful outside the office, and IT departments have adjusted their security rules and policies accordingly.But now, nearly two years into the pandemic, another cybersecurity threat has emerged: employee burnout.Work-related exhaustion isn’t a new phenomenon, but it’s been amplified by Covid-19. And when it’s left unaddressed, burnout can put companies at risk because it influences employees&#39; habits and decision making.To understand the issue, 1Password surveyed 2,500 adults in the U.S. and Canada who are in full-time employment and spend most of their working hours in front of a computer. It’s the focus of our first annual State of Access study, which explores the latest security threats, how workers feel about them, and what businesses should do to protect themselves.Our key findingsBurnout is a huge problem across the U.S. and Canada. 80

A unique feature of 1Password’s security is the Secret Key, but its value is often misunderstood by users and security experts alike. Instead of thinking in terms of “is it like a second factor” or “is it like a key file” it’s best to explain it in terms of what it actually does: It protects you if we were to be breached.What is the Secret Key?The Secret Key is central to what makes 1Password’s security uniquely strong. It offers our users exceedingly strong protection if our servers were to be breached. However, its uniqueness makes it difficult to understand. Not only is it difficult to understand, it places an additional burden on users. Burdening users with an additional task that is hard to understand is really not our style. The fact that we do so should give some idea of just how important the Secret Key is for security.A cracking reviewLet’s review what happens when some service gets breached.

You don’t reuse passwords, so why are you reusing your usernames? Using a unique username does more than just protect your privacy, it also has important security benefits.Below, we’ll explain what threats unique usernames protect you from, when you should use a unique username, and how to use a username generator to create them.The dangers of repetitive usernamesIt’s risky to use the same username for everything. Why? Because if it’s visible to the public, or is exposed in a leak, cybercriminals don’t have to worry about figuring it out when they try to access any of your other online accounts. With more than 61 % of breaches involving credentials used to authenticate a user, having both a unique password and a unique username makes any attempts to breach your account more difficult.Are you guilty of using a variation of your own name or adding some other personal identifying information – like your birth year – to make a new username unique?

Before the pandemic, most millennials didn’t have a will, let alone a plan for handing over their digital accounts.Why? Many simply don’t know how to get started, or worry the process is too expensive, complicated, and time consuming. Others simply feel that it’s not a pressing issue, especially if they’re still healthy or don’t have a lot of savings.The COVID-19 pandemic changed everything, however. It forced millions of millennials to reconsider their health, finances, and relationships, as well as what would happen if they were to suddenly pass away. But has this moment of reflection triggered a wave of new wills and digital estate plans, which include passwords and other online credentials? To find out, we conducted a survey with estate-planning experts Willful and Trust &amp; Will.Some of the findings might surprise you.Takeaways from the U.S.68% of millennials still don’t have a will.

A virtual private network (VPN) is a useful tool that protects your online activity by creating a secure ‘tunnel’ that sits between your device and the site or service you’re trying to access.These days, VPNs are everywhere. Many workers rely on them to access their email and corporate files while they’re outside the office. Others use them to visit sites and watch content that isn’t normally available in their country. Or to better protect their internet traffic while they’re browsing the web on a public Wi-Fi network.Using a VPN is usually quite straightforward: launch the client, click connect. But understanding how one works is trickier. Tunneling? Encapsulation? These terms are hardly commonplace, unless you’re an IT or security professional. Here, we’ll break down the basics and answer a common question: is it always necessary to use a VPN while connected to the internet?The basics: How does a VPN work?A VPN acts as a gatekeeper between your device and whatever you’re trying to i

When the importance of cybersecurity was still emerging, many people didn’t understand what could happen if they weren’t following proper security procedures.But those days are long behind us, so it’s time to retire the scare tactics of the past.I like to call it “spooky security”. It’s when we try to scare people into submission or use fear mongering to force people into behaving more securely. It’s not working, and it’s stopping businesses from building a healthy security culture. A strong culture of security includes individuals not only being aware of policies and procedures but also understanding security and the role they play in it. It also involves employees’ attitudes towards security and how that impacts their actions. If that attitude is fear and uncertainty, they’re less likely to take an active role. An organization with employees disengaged from security is bound to

With each passing year, our digital lives grow in size and complexity. We open new accounts and place more value on the ones we log into and use every day. The trend has led to a rise in digital estate plans – a handover that ensures your friends and family members can take over your most precious accounts after you’ve gone.Creating a plan is one challenge; figuring out what to do with someone else’s is another. Maybe you’ve inherited one, or know a family member who plans to give you their accounts after they’ve passed away. Regardless, it’s important to have a strategy before logging into anything that was once owned by a loved one.Step 1: List the accounts in order of priorityThe first step is to take stock of everything in your loved one’s digital estate plan. Grab a piece of paper or create a digital document and rank the accounts in order of priority. It might seem laborious, but this exercise will help you identify which accounts require your attention first, and just as importa

As we’ve all learned, often the hard way, amazing tech has introduced not-so-amazing risks: viruses, hacks, and leaks, to name a few. A data breach or cyber attack can happen at any moment, to individuals or businesses of any size – and attackers do not discriminate.Many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) may have the “it won’t happen to us” mentality. Smaller teams and tighter resources can lead to the indefinite delay of a security strategy, skipping over cyber insurance, and even a lack of awareness or response when attacks do happen.But as it turns out, SMBs are now targeted by 70 percent of cyber attacks, making them especially vulnerable. At the same time, a majority of small business owners say they aren’t concerned about a potential attack in the next 12 months.To our friends in the SMB community, we want to offer a friendly nudge: You should prepare for anything, because an attack is something your growing business simply can’t afford.

The 1Password Security team is a crew of wonderful characters responsible for security, privacy, and compliance. We have three very high-level objectives:to keep customer data safeto keep company/employee data safeto keep the product safeAnd a lot of (slightly) smaller efforts go into meeting those larger goals. One important onging effort is the tool review, which is an in-depth analysis of a proposed app, tool, or service before it’s used internally. Today, I’ll explore why we chose the tool review method, how we perform our reviews, and share a few things we’ve learned along the way.Why we chose the tool review methodThe in-depth review process isn’t the only way to vet software. Some organizations submit a questionnaire to the developer, others choose their apps based upon reviews and industry recommendations. There’s also the blind faith approach (popular and not recommended).Back when 1Password was a small startup, we’d get excited to try the latest and greatest apps and services

1Password customers can now securely share virtually anything in their 1Password vault with anyone – even if the recipient doesn’t use 1Password.Before I was Chief Product Officer at 1Password, I was a 1Password customer. Back then, I often shared items in my 1Password vault with friends and family who also use 1Password. I shared the Netflix login with my kids, I shared secure notes about doctor’s visits and grocery lists with my wife, and I shared all kinds of things with my colleagues to get our work done securely.But sharing with anyone who doesn’t use 1Password wasn’t as easy. What if my in-laws came to visit and needed the Wi-Fi password? (They’re not 1Password customers, but rest assured, I’m working on that.) What if I needed to share a login with a contractor for a temporary project at work?Sure, I could copy those items from my 1Password vault and paste them somewhere: in an email, in a chat message.

If you own any virtual currency, what will happen to it after you’ve passed away? Would your friends and family know what you owned?

Something your loved ones can follow without being crypto-experts or diving into unfamiliar message boards for assistance.Not sure where to begin? Just follow this guide.Hot or cold?First, understand what you’re trying to hand over. Cryptocurrencies are stored in one of two ways: hot or cold wallets. Many people hear the term ‘wallet’ and believe their funds are held inside, but that’s not the case. A cryptocurrency wallet simply contains the encryption keys required to access assets on a blockchain. It’s the blockchain — a digital ledger held by many people, rather than a single entity — that verifies every transaction and keeps track of who owns what.So if you want to give someone your assets, first figure out how to give them your keys.

We’re often asked about single sign-on (SSO) solutions here at 1Password. We get questions like ‘Can we use 1Password and SSO?’ and ‘Why do we need 1Password if our organization uses SSO?’I’m about to cheat and answer (hopefully) every question at once: You absolutely can (and should) use 1Password alongside a single sign-on solution. Let’s start with a brief overview of the fundamentals.SSO, identity access management (IAM) solutions, and password managers are often conflated because they have similar high-level protocols: one login provides access to multiple accounts. While SSO and password managers aren’t the same — they aren’t mutually exclusive, either.SSO solutions allow users to authenticate with one username and password and use the same login session to access other websites and services. 1Password, at its core, is a password manager that allows users to securely store, fill, and share (if they choose) credentials, personal information, and documents.Now, let’s explore all th

It’s been a while since we ran our challenge, How strong should your Master Password be?, in which we gave out prizes to the first people who could figure out the passwords in carefully constructed challenges.The challenges were designed to simulate the threat to a user who has had their 1Password data stolen from their own machines (1Password data captured from our servers are protected by your Secret Key and so aren’t subject to this sort of attack). After paying out a total of $30,720 USD, we have a better picture.The short answer is that it costs the password cracker about $6 USD for every 2³² (4.3 billion) guesses of a 1Password account password. An attacker, on average, only needs to try half of all the possible passwords, and had we not provided hints, it would have cost the attackers $4,300 USD to crack the three-word passwords in our challenge.This figure of $6 USD per 2³² guesses allows us to calculate the cracking costs for any known password strength.

Greetings everyone!

Before we get into that, though, I think a bit of backstory is warranted.1Password 7, 6, 5, 4…With a fifteen year history, 1Password has seen a lot of changes across all our supported platforms, but the way we’ve built our apps has largely been the same over those years. The very first version of 1Password was built by Dave and Roustem as a weekend project to help them with their day jobs of building websites. They got tired of manually filling in usernames, passwords, and contact information to test the sites they were building and figured they could build a tool to automate that. This weekend project quickly took over their day job and spawned a whole company and industry.The first version of 1Password was a Mac app with a small team of four dedicated to it. Whe

If you’re reading this, and you don’t live under a rock, you know organizational security is important. But, these days, the term ‘organizational security’ means so much more than it has in the past. It’s not quite as simple as installing a highly-rated anti-virus solution on employees&#39; computers and calling it a day.One can hire the best IT security people, purchase the most secure software, and procure the services with the safest and most private practices, and it’s still not enough. As we’ve learned, even high-profile organizations with every resource at their disposal aren’t immune to missteps.What that organization, and many organizations just like it, lack is a true culture of security.A what?A culture of security is the collective habits of employees who engage in security defences, and actively help protect an organization. When everyone on your team, from entry-level folks to your CFO, has an interest in the safety of operational data, you’ve created a security culture. As I

I have some fantastic news to share. Today we’re announcing a new investment round in 1Password. Our current investor Accel led this round and a number of incredible folks including Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures and top executives from Shopify, Slack, Squarespace, Google, Eventbrite, MessageBird and Atlassian also came on board.That’s a pretty awesome list of partners, but why would we take a second round when we are still profitable? Let’s take a little trip back in time to roughly two years ago to find out.Taking that first funding stepIt was the summer of 2019 and founders Dave, Sara, Roustem, Natalia and I were discussing whether or not we should partner with Accel and take our first ever funding round.1Password was successful, profitable and growing so we didn’t need the money. We also knew that we had something truly special and wanted to make sure we weren’t going to screw things up. At the same time 1Password needed to grow in order to help as many people as we wanted to, and

Have you ever been convinced that your devices are listening to what you’re saying? We’ve all been there. Despite popular belief, your gadgets aren’t eavesdropping – but they are tracking everything you’re doing online and creating a hyper-personalized mega profile that advertisers use for targeted marketing.Here are some of the easiest ways to reduce your digital footprint and take back control of your privacy online.Privacy vs security: What’s the difference?While privacy and security are often thought of as synonymous, or used interchangeably, there are actually distinct differences between the two. Security is about protecting your data from being accessed without your consent, whereas privacy is your ability to choose what information you share. Privacy is a bit like sending a message in an envelope versus a postcard that anyone can read. While security is like sending a message in a lockbox that no one else has the key to open.Privacy is almost always context-sensitive. If you’re

Visibility is critical to security and IT teams. If they can’t see what’s going on, they can’t act. So today we’re giving security and IT greater data visibility with Events API, a public REST API for 1Password Business customers.In addition to the events that have always been available to admins, item usage and successful and failed sign-in attempts can now be routed to third-party platforms to create dashboards, alerts, and much more.With greater visibility, security and IT teams can now correlate 1Password events with other data sources to gain a deeper understanding of how workers are using 1Password.We’ve built the API with SOC (Security Operations Center) and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools in mind – database tools which analyze and present time series event data with alerts, dashboards, visualization, and search.

Simple, well-tested protocols prevent disasters.Food allergiesMy daughter has a life-threatening food allergy, so eating out is always a little scary. Over the years, we have learned which restaurants are “safe” for her and which are not. Those restaurants that are safe for her have one thing in common – an established protocol for dealing with food allergies. The typical protocol is something along these lines:Inform the server of the food allergy and the specific allergen.The server informs the kitchen of the allergy.The manager makes the food or supervises the making of the food.Her food is brought out on a special plate or by the manager.Having a documented protocol allows us to enforce adherence to the protocol, and the simplicity of the protocol allows us to easily spot violations. As an example, one restaurant we visited frequently would plate all allergy orders on yellow plates instead of their usual white. If my daughter’s order came out on a white plate, we spoke to the manag

We know that many businesses use identity providers like Okta, Rippling and Azure Active Directory to control what their employees have access to. That’s why we built the 1Password SCIM bridge — a way to connect these services with our enterprise password manager. It streamlines common administrator tasks, such as setting up new employees with a 1Password account and granting them access to specific groups.To sync everything up, all of our customers that want to leverage automated provisioning deploy the SCIM bridge on one of their own servers. But that made us ask the question: what would happen if a SCIM bridge went down? Could we do more to help companies diagnose and fix the problem?To solve this issue, we decided to build health monitoring, a tool that administrators can use to quickly check on their SCIM bridge and narrow down any technical issues. We had a good idea of how this should work, but we’re in the password management business, not the server monitoring business. Buildi

If you’ve heard the news in the last month or so, I’m sure you know about the Colonial pipeline cyber attack that took place at the end of April. If you’ve not heard about this, I’ll summarize the story.On April 29, 2021, hackers gained access to the network of the largest fuel pipeline in the United States. The attack led to a ransom payment of $4.4 million and fuel shortages throughout the east coasts of the US and Canada.I work in cybersecurity so I understand the risks we face in this digital world. But when an organization of this scale is thwarted by the smallest security gap, I still think, “How does that happen?”On a purely technical level, I can tell you. The attackers - believed to be members of an infamous cybercrime group - hacked into the network through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). The VPN account that acted as the gateway for the attack wasn’t in use at the time, but it was still active (we’ll get to that in a minute).The password was the other problem. It was later

With most breaches caused by weak, reused, or stolen credentials, it’s time to talk about your passwords.Times have changed, passwords haven’tBusinesses have relied on passwords for more than 70 years. Back then, and until the rise of enterprise software, there was little need for long, complex passwords. A pet’s name or a spouse’s birthday worked just fine. Fast forward a few decades, and it’s a different story. An estimated 81% of data breaches are now caused by compromised credentials.If data wasn’t valuable, hackers wouldn’t hack itThe prevalence of cookies, trackers, and other data collection tools has boosted the volume and value of a company’s data assets. Even the smallest company has something to lose from a breach, the most precious being its reputation as a trusted place to do business.

Let me tell you why.The SecretHub storyThe first product we built at SecretHub was a secure, end-to-end encrypted file syncing service. While working on that application, we ran into an interesting problem.Like everyone else, we were deploying more frequently than ever before, sometimes multiple times a day. And like every cloud application, our software needed a handful of credentials to access a database and a few APIs. But where to put those credentials?We had two options. We could put the secrets in our code (or somewhere else where they would be visible to a number of people) but that would leave them exposed. Or we could restrict access to one person (me) and manually input the creden

We know there are several password managers to choose from. They all have different names but promise to do the same thing: protect your employees’ accounts with complex, hard to guess passwords. So why choose 1Password for your business? There are many reasons, but the most important is our promise to prioritize your privacy over everything else.Encryption you can rely onWe have many protections in place to stop would-be attackers from accessing our servers. (It’s no coincidence that we’ve never been hacked!) And even if a thief somehow slipped through, they would only have access to reams of scrambled information. That’s because 1Password uses end-to-encryption to safeguard everything that your team has in their accounts. Unless the hacker had access to everyone’s decryption keys, the data would be worthless.Every team member’s decryption key comes in two parts.

In the Compilation of Many Breaches (COMB), more than 3 billion unique sets of login credentials have been shared online in what some say is the largest data breach of all time.Though it seems that no new login information has been exposed, the compilation and sharing of so much data significantly increases the risk that previously exposed credentials could be used to gain access to online accounts – particularly where passwords have been reused.With an event of this magnitude, it’s crucial to stay informed and take steps to prevent your online accounts being compromised, whether at home or at work. In a nutshell, that means changing affected passwords ASAP.

Identity fraud has become a growing problem as more people work, socialize, and shop online. Unsurprisingly, having your identity stolen has a significant impact on your financial and mental health, and it can take years to recover. And unfortunately, identity theft, credit card fraud, and having your bank accounts compromised are only the tip of the iceberg.ContentsEmerging scamsPandemic-centric identity fraudEarly signs of identity theftPrevent fraudIn April last year, Google reported that nearly one-fifth of all phishing scams were related to coronavirus. Based on previous trends, especially given the effects of the pandemic, we can expect another increase in identity fraud scams in 2021. As scams evolve, it’s important to learn how to spot them so you can protect yourself from these kinds of attacks.Emerging scamsWhen lockdowns started in March, banking online became a new reality for many, and online shopping increased exponentially.

If you keep an eye on security headlines, you may have seen the news that up to one in five work passwords include the company name.This is according to new research by data protection specialists Acronis, which also suggests that around 80 percent of companies don’t have an established password policy. Both stats are concerning from the point of view of businesses’ online security – but they are trivial to fix if you use an enterprise password manager.The problem with non-random passwordsPeople use the name of the company they work for as part of their password to make it memorable. When people are forced to remember passwords, especially those that they need to change regularly, it carries the unintended consequence of making passwords less secure.People rotate through minor variations of the same base password, such as using their company name with a few extra characters on the end, to check off password policy requirements while still being able to remember their password.The probl

Right now at 1Password, we’re in the process of a large-scale development effort focused on the apps that our customers use every day on macOS, iOS, Windows, Android, and in the browser.We kicked off this effort with the addition of a new platform where we’ve never had a desktop app before: Linux. At the genesis of this project we had a lot of internal discussions about programming languages, tech stacks, toolkits, and more. However, one thing we never disagreed on was our commitment to continue building great apps.We’ve been developing native apps since 2004 so we understand the value they bring to our customers – things like offline access, deep integration with system features, and the ability to manage more than passwords. With every new platform we support, we strive to deliver an experience that feels like the 1Password you know and love, but also feels right at home on the platform you’re using.Your passwords, right where you need themIf you’re a 1Password customer there’s a goo

2020 is over – we can finally say it out loud. While we may not be able to put everything behind us, there are a few things we can pack up and wave a cheery goodbye to. The first one that comes to mind? Bad online security.While it might not be the most obvious new year’s resolution, scrubbing up online habits can be a little more exciting than ushering in a reduced Netflix schedule.Internet use changed dramatically over the past year, as companies moved to hybrid work and families opted for virtual gatherings. This shift in online activity comes with an increase in vulnerabilities due to careless online habits, like weak passwords and reusing the same password for multiple accounts (hint: Changing the number at the end just isn’t good enough).The good news is that, with a few simple changes, you can set yourself up for security success this year.Start with emailThink of your email as the gateway to each of your other accounts.

Please feel free to download the report right away, but I did also want to take a moment to share a few highlights and thoughts.A brighter, more secure futureKicking off on a note of optimism, I’m personally delighted to see that, according to our survey, 40% of parents talk about online security with their preschool children. Yes, that number could be higher, but it still amounts to a huge number of parents talking about online safety with young children. The idea that 40% of little ones are budding security and privacy advocates is very heartening indeed.Points of concernPerhaps inevitably, though, points of concern do arise – particularly when we dig into the areas of password use and password sh

My new 13” MacBook Pro arrived on Friday and the first thing I did was install 1Password to see how things perform on the new M1 chip.The current official release of 1Password was built to target an Intel x86 architecture so Big Sur prompted me to install Rosetta to translate things to run on Apple Silicon.My heart sank a little as hardware emulation is often slow. Upon launching, however, I was surprised to find 1Password launched as fast as ever. This was an incredible delight for sure. Apple really hit the mark here and the developer in me is very thankful they made this transition so smooth.Of course I wanted to enjoy all the power of this new M1 chip so I tried our new beta release which comes as a universal binary. This means it includes both Intel and Apple Silicon instruction sets, allowing macOS to choose the best for the machine it’s running on.This is where things really heated up. 1Password built for Apple Silicon running on the M1 is incredibly fast! 🏎🔥1Password launches...

More than 80% involve lost or stolen credentials, or use brute force – guessing different combinations of characters to crack a password.With as many as 65% of people reusing passwords for their accounts, it only takes one leaked password to open the door to others – including some you may not have visibility of.The best way to defend against these types of attacks is to act fast: identify the breach and update exposed passwords to strong, unique alternatives.Notify everyone affected in a few clicksNow you can send a customizable email notification to everyone who has been affected by a breach, including th

Our Chief of Security (AKA Chief Defender Against the Dark Arts), Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote a fascinating article back in 2012 that ended with this:1Password, like pretty much all cryptographic software, needs cryptographically secure random numbers to do its stuff securely. What it means for a number to be cryptographically secure, why 1Password needs such numbers, and where it gets those from will be the subject of a future article.It’s been eight years, and I’m here to make good on that pledge with said article. Good things come to those who wait and all that, right? I won’t make any promises that what you’re about to read will be a “good thing” but let’s shoot for the stars.That’s (not) so randomAs I’ve alluded to with the title of this post, humans are notoriously terrible at creating randomness.For example, if I ask you to choose a number between 1 and 10, statistics show about 30% of you will choose 7.

With Android 11 comes support for displaying autofill results in the suggestions strip above your keyboard.Now, you can see your logins from 1Password as suggestions in Gboard when signing in to supported apps and browsers.This feels like a natural fit, as the suggestion strip already supports smart suggestions, emojis, and pasting from the clipboard.Protect your privacy with app permissionsAndroid 11 also gives you even more control over the permissions for apps, like access to your mic, location data, or camera.You can set permissions to automatically expire, so if you haven’t used an app for a while, it won’t continue to access your information.

Back in May, we released the first installment of findings from a survey we conducted of 1,000 US knowledge workers, including 500 IT department personnel. Those findings shed light on the opportunities and challenges that companies faced as they embarked on their remote work journey, and the largely overlooked successful job of IT in leading the transition.The next chapter of this research, released today, dives into the enormous amount of time IT spends managing Identity and Access Management (IAM), and how this influences the quest that all enterprises have to achieve the holy grail of security, productivity, and convenience.Our research paints a picture of shadow IT that is more complicated than many of us expected. While most employees do follow IT’s rules, a small group of workers tries to get more work done by circumventing company policies — and sometimes those workers are enabled by IT personnel who grapple with limited resources and empathize with their pursuit of productivit

The end of the academic semester is always bittersweet at 1Password – a time when we part ways with the talented people who’ve joined us for an internship over the weeks before. Bittersweet because it’s always sad to say goodbye to new friends, but lovely to reflect on the valuable contribution they’ve made to 1Password – both our product and our culture.This year I wanted to share some thoughts from Mio who interned with us over the spring semester as part of the integrations team, working on the command-line tool. I hope Mio’s story gives you some insight into what it’s like to intern at 1Password – and hopefully encourage you to get in touch if it’s something you’d like to do in future. We’re always thrilled to have new students join the team.Take it away Mio…I got to introduce secure password generation to the command-line interface (CLI). I think it’s an awesome feature for a passwordmanager to have, so being able to add that to the CLI myself was honestly pretty exciting.Nothing

CorrectionIt was back in March when researchers discovered that a popular video-sharing service was accessing users’ iOS clipboard contents without permission. Apple vowed to address the problem.At last week’s WWDC 2020, Apple made good on their promise with the release of the iOS 14 developer beta which, among other great security enhancements, notifies you when an application accesses your clipboard.It’s now been revealed that a number of other apps (53, to be precise) access the iOS clipboard without consent.This has sparked a lot of conversation, questions, and concern from our customers, and I’d love the chance to address the issue.What this meansIt’s important to remember that nothing has really changed – this clipboard “scraping” has happened for some time. The only difference is that, with the release of iOS 14, you’ll know when it happens. And knowledge is power.

1Password has always been a remote-first company. But how have other organizations adapted to remote and hybrid work, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic?In the spring of 2020, we polled knowledge workers in the U.S. to find out how the opportunities and challenges of remote work were affecting companies and their employees.The responses underlined the scale of the changes that had taken place, and the role IT played in enabling it. (That’s IT both in terms of the technology itself, and the professionals that make IT happen.) Here, we’ll share some of our findings and talk about the heroic efforts we saw in IT departments.We only spoke with workers in the U.S, but have no reason to think these findings weren’t representative of other businesses around the world.Before we go any further, here are a couple of the most important stats:89% of respondents had no criticism of their company’s IT team.

You may have heard about contact tracing apps, which are designed to help health authorities identify people who have been in contact with someone infected with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus which causes COVID-19. It’s natural to worry that such apps could be used to collect data about who you meet and where you go.Fortunately, there is some clever technology that leaves the user in control and protects privacy, while giving individuals and health authorities the information they need. Apple and Google are introducing that technology to their phones.I fully anticipate that I’ll enable the relevant app that uses this exposure notification technology when it becomes available, and that I’ll encourage others to, as well.Privacy still mattersIt’s reasonable to ask whether privacy preservation still matters when there is a pressing and compelling public health need for improved contact tracing.

Some organizations are born with remote culture and security, some achieve it, and some have it thrust upon them. It’s important to understand that setting the wrong goals can backfire. Take a step back and look at some of the greater changes you face.1Password came into the world as a fully remote organization 14 years ago. Even though we’ve opened two offices in that time, the majority of our staff still work remotely. Although nobody has an easy time of anything these days, we were in a far better position to adapt than most when we had to suddenly shutter those offices on March 10, 2020. It didn’t require the development and implementation of new security policies and practices for remote workers.Yet we can understand what those suddenly thrust into such a change are confronted with.It is our business to help people and organizations improve their security in ways that work for those people.

As the COVID-19 situation develops, businesses are scrambling to adjust to the new reality of remote and hybrid work. The sudden nature of this shift has meant IT teams are ill-prepared for the security implications of remote working.One such risk is shadow IT – the use of apps and services by employees without the knowledge or oversight of your IT team. In our recent look at the risks of shadow IT, we saw that a remarkable 63.5 percent of workers had created at least one shadow IT account in the 12 months prior to our survey.Right now, the use of shadow IT is only likely to increase as people find new workflows to replace old ones that are suddenly unfit for purpose. And people will be all the more tempted by extended free trials offered in the spate of home-working caused by coronavirus.

As we all adjust to our new normal and many of us are doing remote or hybrid work for the first time, it’s important to look beyond productivity advice and consider the deeper impact of this situation.There are plenty of reports that highlight the benefits of remote working, but it also has consequences for our mental and emotional health that need to be carefully considered.As an experienced remote team these are lessons we’ve been able to learn over the last 14 years, but it can’t be emphasized enough that nothing about this situation is “normal”. All of the struggles and side effects of hybrid work will be amplified by current events, so it’s more important than ever to be aware of them and to look after yourself.Stop worrying about productivityIt’s likely you’re finding it hard to be productive right now because there’s a lot going on. You might have kids at home, be working in a new and distracting environment, or just worrying more than usual – you’re not alone. A new report from

If you signed up for 1Password in Safari and aren’t already using one of the 1Password apps, it’s important to start today. Here’s why.Apple has always been at the forefront of the fight to protect your privacy, and the WebKit team that builds the foundation of Safari is no exception. In 2017, they introduced Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which helps prevent advertisers from tracking you when you use Safari. This was great news for privacy, and a lot of us at 1Password use Safari because of its strong commitment to privacy.Starting in Safari 13.1 for Mac and iOS 13.4, there are some additional changes to Intelligent Tracking Prevention. Information a website stores in local storage will now be erased if you don’t visit that website at least once every 7 days. This affects full-featured web apps like 1Password that use local storage for legitimate purposes. For example, 1Password stores your Secret Key in local storage.

Many businesses are having to rush to remote or hybrid working for the first time, but it’s important not to let your security slide during the transition. By taking a few simple precautions, remote work can be as secure as working from an office full-time. These tips will help your whole team do remote and hybrid work safely, wherever they are in the world.HardwareThe first thing is to make sure you work with devices set up to keep company information safe.Use the safest device available.If your computers are provided by work, use them. If they’re not, make sure you work from your own device. Don’t work from public computers, or computers belonging to friends, family or anyone else – these could be insecure in any number of ways. If it’s possible to designate a computer solely to work, it’s a good idea to do that.Set up device passwords.Make sure all devices you work with are password-protected. If someone finds one unattended, you don’t want them to be able to use it.Encrypt storage.

From project management software to plugins that correct your grammar, it seems like a new tool for supercharging workers’ productivity launches every day. While that’s great for innovation, there’s a downside: the accounts employees create without a business’s authorization or awareness, known as shadow IT.At first glance, shadow IT might appear harmless. The problem is, without the oversight and direction of IT, it’s easy for employees to unwittingly create vulnerabilities in even the tightest of security setups.How prevalent is shadow IT?There’s plenty of anecdotal evidence of how disruptive shadow IT accounts can be, but we wanted data.So, we surveyed a representative sample of 2,119 U.S. adults who work in an office with an IT department and use a computer for work (see end of post for methodology), and found that a staggering 63.5% (± 1.03) of respondents have created at least one account in the past 12 months that their IT department doesn’t know about:Yes 63.5% (± 1.03)No 36.5%

Here’s what’s new in 1Password X 1.17.New filling brain written in Rust1Password’s filling brain is the technology responsible for autofilling your information. The brain analyzes webpages in the background so it can suggest relevant items to fill in the available fields.In 1Password X 1.17, we’ve completely rewritten the brain in Rust and WebAssembly. Rust gives us a boost in both speed and portability – making it smarter, faster, and more embeddable in all our apps.Not to get too technical on you, but we’re now using Rust libraries to power many parts of the extension, including all Markdown parsing and time-based one-time password (TOTP) generation. By taking advantage of Rust’s ability to compile to WebAssembly, we can now share this implementation across all of our apps.New inline menuThe

‘Tis the season for travel, shopping, and family visits, and this tends to leave us busy and distracted. Scammers and crooks like to take advantage of this, so here are some tips for staying safe and merry over the holidays.No holiday promo is worth risking your securityThe holiday season brings a drastic increase in emails. Phishing scams are a favorite of cybercriminals, and the lasting popularity of online shopping has made email phishing even more effective. Be wary of emails with attachments like fake receipts or invoices. These files can expose your computer and account to malware, keyloggers, and ransomware when you open the attachment.Malicious links like false purchase verifications or shipping notifications offer prime opportunities for hackers to steal your login credentials. And if you’ve reused those login credentials on multiple sites your other accounts may be vulnerable.Secure your wallet when shoppingOnline shopping saves time during the busy holiday season.

CEO fraud is a simple scam that has cost businesses USD$26 billion worldwide since 2016, according to the FBI. We’re calling for CEOs to step up to protect their business. All it takes is a conversation.What is CEO fraud?1Password (like many others) has experienced a recent spate of phishing attempts. The team received emails from an attacker pretending to be me, asking for personal information. Although the scam wasn’t successful at 1Password, businesses all over the world have been less fortunate.CEO fraud is a form of BEC (Business Email Compromise). An attacker spoofs the email address of the CEO or poses as them in an email. In the message, they ask an employee to transfer money to an account they control, or to provide personal or financial information.Often, the message will invoke a sense of urgency and put pressure on employees to act quickly. Here’s a real example that resulted in USD$8million going missing.“Hey, the deal is done. Please wire USD$8 million to this account to

I wanted to be the first one to tell you: I’m incredibly proud to announce that we’ve partnered with Accel to help 1Password continue the amazing growth and success we’ve seen over the past 14 years. Accel will be investing USD$200 million for a minority stake in 1Password. Along with the investment – their largest initial investment in their 35-year history – Accel brings the experience and expertise we need to grow further and faster.1Password is a completely bootstrapped company that’s never taken a dime of outside investment, so this announcement may surprise some of you. We’ve built the most-loved password manager and a world-class company, all while remaining profitable during our entire history. So why, after 14 years of self-funding, are we now partnering with Accel? That’s a great question. To answer it, let’s visit our founding heroes where it all began.We’ve come so farWhen Roustem and I founded 1Password in 2005, we were trying to solve a simple problem. We were developing

Now, I’m seriously considering swapping my iPad for a new Surface Pro. Here’s why.Privacy-focused browsingI’ve been using Edge on my Mac for a few months now, and I’ve been impressed by its performance and security features.

1Password 7 was released over a year ago, and thanks to all the new features we’ve added since, there’s never been a better time to upgrade. Let’s take a look at what you get with the latest and greatest version of 1Password.1Password mini1Password mini has a beautiful new design in 1Password 7. Every pixel has been reimagined to give you more information and control, so you can keep all your passwords, credit cards, and other important items right at your fingertips.

Thought I’d go with the obvious Star Wars reference? I have to admit it was tempting, but villains monopolize the dark side in that universe. Heroes can have a dark side too, as evidenced by our friend the Dark Knight, and Dark Theme is definitely the hero feature of this release!Without further ado, and only a few more pop culture references, let’s get into what’s new in 1Password for Android 7.2.Dark ThemeThe new feature I’m most excited about in 1Password also happens to be my favourite new feature in Android Q. When it launches later this summer, Android Q will bring support for a system-wide Dark Theme. And 1Password will be ready and waiting with our new gothic stylings.I only work in black … and sometimes very, very dark greyWhile we did darken things dramatically, we didn’t quite limit our palate to Bat-approved colours.

As people grow more cautious of online tracking and data collection, space is opening up for privacy-conscious browsers like Brave, a relative newcomer that’s enjoying some time in the spotlight. To see what all the fuss is about, I’ve been giving Brave a spin.A quick introduction to BraveDeveloped by Brendan Eich, co-founder of Mozilla, Brave is a privacy-focused browser built on open-source Chromium.The backbone of Brave is the same as Chrome, so it shares a lot of its plus points: It has the same clean look, you can install extensions from the Chrome Store, and it syncs across devices. Brave supports Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.Getting startedGetting Brave set up is easy. When you launch the browser for the first time, a welcome tour helps you import any bookmarks and settings from your old browser.You can install 1Password for your browser straight from the Google Chrome Web Store.

On Monday, Apple released the macOS Catalina public beta that includes a preview of Safari 13, which is set for release this fall.

I’ve used 1Password far longer than I’ve worked here, but until I came on board I only used the Mac and mobile apps. Although I knew that there was a browser-based option, I didn’t give it much thought until I was poking around during my new-hire training.Honestly, what took me so long? Within a few weeks of discovering that 1Password X existed, it became the primary way I use 1Password on my computer.1Password X is a full-featured version of 1Password that runs entirely within a browser. It runs on my Linux machine just as smoothly as it does my Mac. And because 1Password X connects to your 1Password account, you have access to everything you expect. That’s extremely helpful if you’re anything like a lot of us here and find yourself jumping between different computers and platforms multiple times a day.How does it work?Although I first discovered 1Password X on Linux, it quickly became my preferred way of using 1Password on Mac as well.

The most exciting news for our team was the announcement of brand new versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS! Roo has already talked about how impressed he is by Voice Control in iOS 13 and how excited he is for Dark Mode for iOS to finally arrive.If you’re a member of the Apple Developer Program, the developer beta versions of all three pieces of software announced at WWDC are already available to download and install.All of the software previews were absolutely stunning, and we know 1Password 7 will look amazing on all of them.

You can now use U2F-compatible security keys as a second factor for your 1Password account.Last year we added two-factor authentication to provide another layer of protection for your 1Password account. When this is enabled, you are prompted to enter your second factor any time you sign in from a new device.Initially, that second factor was a time-based one-time password generated by an authenticator app on your phone. Today, I’m happy to announce a new option: We now offer support for Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)-compatible security keys. This is done via the new WebAuthn API, and we’re excited to be among the first services to adopt this new browser standard. WebAuthn is backwards-compatible with U2F, so all certified U2F security keys will work with our WebAuthn-enabled flow.What is a security key?Security keys are small physical devices that can be used as a second factor.

While it’s still only in beta, it feels speedy enough that it could easily fit into my day-to-day workflow without slowing me down or dragging my tasks out.And the best part is that on my Mac, Microsoft Edge not only looks like a native Mac application but it functions like one, too. All my go-to keyboard shortcuts work exactly as I expect them to, which means I don’t have to move my mouse to open 1Password!

For the last several months the Design and Development team at 1Password has been hard at work on a major renovation to the smallest part of everyone’s favorite password manager: 1Password mini.Since we launched 1Password 7 last May, we’ve received more feedback about that incarnation of 1Password mini than any other part of our version 7 update. Given that it was such a significant departure from its predecessor, we anticipated this feedback. Instead of snapping into reaction mode, we took a wait-and-see approach; change is hard, and we didn’t want to jump to the wrong conclusions. Over time, we built up a wish list of improvements we wanted to bring to 1Password mini and we set off on our journey.Core competenciesBefore a single mockup or wireframe was created, we took a step back to define exactly what 1Password mini needed to do well:Show items that match the frontmost app or website.Fill your passwords, credit cards, and address information into a web page.Generate new passwords q

With several countries observing a mental health awareness week in May, now is a great time to think about how we care for ourselves and others. We are all worthy of support, encouragement, and happiness. Sometimes feeling okay is easier said than done, but by carving out a bit of time each day to focus on mental and physical health, we can work towards that reality together.Here at 1Password, a huge part of our culture is being positive and working to bring the “wow” factor to our customers – but to do that, we need to take time to recharge ourselves, too. That’s why we encourage folks to get active during the day, and spend time doing things they love. Whether we’re coding amazing new features or helping answer questions from awesome users, it’s a pretty sedentary job. Having activities outside of work – like going to the gym, yoga, a darts league, or squash – gets you moving, helps the body stay active, and feeds the brain. :)We also do a few things within 1Password to help keep peo

Since 1Password was founded in 2005, customer support has been at the heart of everything we do. I’ve been working with a small team to build CSX, a Chrome extension that makes providing support as easy as 1Password makes managing your passwords.Why do we need a tool like CSX?As 1Password grows, so do the number of customers we talk to. To make sure we have time to give every reply the thought it deserves, we wanted to automate the repetitive, more administrative parts of the process.For example, we’ll often get an email that mentions a forum thread or Twitter conversation. Finding that discussion is a repetitive, time-consuming endeavor, and it would be much better if we could spend that time crafting our reply.To give one more example, we have a collection of “Charms”, which let a new team member know how to write the perfect response for every situation. These are new to us and we’ll likely write about them in the future, but suffice it to say, they help us ensure that every custome

Don’t worry, we haven’t completely lost our minds over here — it’s just April Fool’s day!At 1Password we take privacy and security very seriously, and we think everybody else should too. That’s why we would never really suggest ditching your password manager for a cute password book you keep on your desk.And while writing down lots of unique passwords is admittedly safer than reusing the same password for everything, it still isn’t anywhere near as safe as using a password manager, and it certainly isn’t as convenient.Password books can get lost, damaged, or accessed by other people — and, worse, they encourage people to use weak, easy-to-type passwords (because if you’re manually typing things in, you don’t want to spend forever doing it). Our password generator creates passwords like =Rw}U5Wx}cHxc)2g6-^Z#7. Imagine writing dozens of passwords like that in a notebook, and copying them out each time you need to use them.

Today, Facebook revealed that 200–600 million user passwords had been stored in a plain text file on an internal server. This left the affected users vulnerable and searchable by more than 20,000 employees – with around 2000 taking advantage of this. However, Facebook did state that no passwords were shared or leaked externally.Any affected users will be directly notified, and Facebook is not advising anyone to change their password. But, given the number of employees who accessed those passwords, we’d urge you to err on the side of caution and change yours just in case.Instances like this, where passwords are stored and accessible in plain text, are a good example why you should use a unique password for each site. Having a unique password means that the bad practices of one company don’t lead to your account being compromised on other sites where you use the same password.To keep your passwords truly secure, change them any time you suspect they’ve been compromised. We know it can be

One of the challenges as a remote company is that we’re scattered all across the world, which makes it difficult to meet in person. That’s why all of us at 1Password eagerly look forward to our annual meetup, AGConf, which is held each winter on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.We met up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Many of us were escaping cold and snow back home, and what better way to soak up the sun than to spend a week aboard Royal Caribbean’s Independence of the Seas — with stops in Nassau, Haiti, and Jamaica?Pre-cruise hangoutsWith people coming in from overseas, one even as far as New Zealand, a lot of folks like to get to Florida a day early. It helps them adjust to the time zone and get a good night’s sleep on land before venturing onto the boat.One group met up to get dinner and drinks at a tiki bar, another group went out in search of excellent Cuban sandwiches, and a lot of people just hung out in small groups in their hotel lobbies.

Scams that try to extract personal information via phishing sites, phone calls, or SMS are on the rise. It’s something we covered in detail in What is phishing, and how can you protect yourself?As someone who works for 1Password, security is a big focus of mine. I’m happy to admit that this job has made me far more paranoid than I used to be, and naturally I use 1Password to make sure all my passwords are strong, unique, and have never been included in any breach. I’ve read our internal security guide many times over, and I took part in a company-wide security training session just recently at our annual company get-together.You’d think all this preparation would keep me safe from phishing – but last week, I was nearly caught by an SMS phishing attempt.

The New Year’s resolutions we stick to have a few things in common: they’re realistic, focused, and have clear benefits. That’s why improving company-wide password habits is a great resolution for 2019.According to the most recent data from Verizon, over 70% of employees reuse passwords at work. The report also finds a staggering 81% of hacking-related breaches used stolen or weak passwords. A security breach of your own wouldn’t be a great start to the year, especially if you know it could have been avoided.1Password Business makes improving password habits an easy resolution for you and your employees to keep, both at work and at home. You get a password solution for your entire business — complete with advanced access controls and Watchtower breach monitoring — that’s compliant to the most stringent industry standards.When your employees are practicing good password habits at home, they are infinitely more likely to practice them at work.

Australia recently passed the so-called Assistance and Access Act. This law (correctly) has many digital security and privacy experts worried. We’d like to offer some preliminary remarks on how it may impact the privacy and security of 1Password customers and how it may affect the way we work.Even at this early stage we can remind everyone that we do not currently, and will not introduce back doors into our products, and we will continue to operate in a way that would make it difficult for a back door to be inserted.Our remarks on the Assistance and Access Act (discussed under the hashtag #aaBill) must be preliminary at this point. There is a great deal of vagueness in the law in its current form, and we do not know how it will be interpreted and used when it goes into effect into effect. Nonetheless there are a number of things that we can clearly (re)state now.We don’t like back doorsA back door is a deliberate and hidden weakness in a system that is designed to allow certain people

Random but Memorable is back with an episode full of a new Watchtower Weekly, customer questions, and even a chat with Charles Arthur, author of Cyber Wars: Hacks that Shocked the Business World.Watchtower Weekly talked briefly about the Marriott breach, which potentially impacts nearly 500 million Marriott and Starwood customers. Data exposure can always leave you vulnerable, so it’s a good idea to take Marriott up on their offer for a free year of WebWatcher to monitor your information. They also brought up a rather embarrassing incident for Tesla in which a disgruntled customer complaining to their customer support forum got more than he bargained for. Instead of just an answer, a support agent ended up giving him administrative permissions for the entire forum! That’s right, he was granted full access to the entire forum.

People love using 1Password with their favorite apps. Other developers have integrated 1Password into their own apps because they were eager to offer their customers the very best experience. As developers ourselves, and people who use those apps, we can’t thank them enough for their work.Changes to the way iOS and Android handle password management and filling have given 1Password an opportunity to make password filling better than ever. It’s never been easier to use strong, secure passwords for every website and app you use. With support for Authentication Services and Password AutoFill in iOS 12 and the Autofill API in Android 8 (Oreo), 1Password is ready for the next step in our journey. And things will get even better as developers fully support all the new tools on offer.I’ve been using the latest autofill features on iOS and Android, and they’re brilliant. Entering passwords on a phone has never been easier. In fact, it’s downright fun. I’m a little bit in love with the work dev

We’ve had a lightbulb moment and added Dark Mode to our blog. It makes it more readable, more enjoyable, and more fun than ever before. Read on to find out how we did it and how you can add it to your own website.Dark Mode in Mojave is great for apps, but until now websites didn’t have a way to participate in the fun. Apple just gave us a gift with their latest update to Safari Technology Preview, and we’ve been having fun exploring the new possibilities.Welcome to the dark side 🌗Today I’m happy to say that the 1Password blog is now 100% compatible with Dark Mode, and the experience is fantastic. 🎉Although the Safari app itself has supported Dark Mode ever since macOS Mojave debuted, websites had no way to know when their content was being presented in Dark Mode. You saw the same color scheme on each website, no matter which mode your Mac was in.Safari Technology Preview 68 changed this by adding support for the prefers-color-scheme media query.

Today’s Apple Event in NYC was one of my favorites in years. From the new Macs, to the new iPads, to 1Password making an awesome cameo on stage it had everything I could want in an Apple keynote.Full disclosure before we go any further in today’s post, folks: I am tapping into a deep vein of long-running Apple fanboyism. If you’d rather not hear me gush about all the stuff that was announced at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, here’s the gist: 1Password on stage, woo! Brand new iPad Pros with Face ID, incredible! New MacBook Airs (with Touch ID) and Mac minis, fantastic!Speaking of that cameo, we were super surprised and honored to show up on the screen behind Laura. Touch ID on the Mac is one of my favorite features and having Apple use 1Password to show it off to the world was just terrific. 🙏￼Brand New MacsNow I don’t care to engage in hyperbole, and the word “finally” is usually uttered in a wry tone, but seeing new a whole new model of Mac mini finally announced today was so great....

Last month, we launched Random but Memorable, a bi-monthly security advice podcast. Random but Memorable is named after your Master Password, but is also very appropriate for the show. The “memorable” part mainly comes from my co-host Michael Fey (Roo) not reading the show notes until we start recording, and the “random” part is a direct result of this.In our first episode, Correct Battery Horse Pilot we talk about our iOS 12 and Mojave beta releases, and discuss the security news of the week. We experimented with a few ending segments of lighthearted banter but settled on trying to pronounce odd-looking place names, starting with the British city of Loughbrough.The second installment is called Machine Factor Toaster Data and introduces our first guest, Mitchell Cohen, who works on 1Password X. We discuss what 1Password X is and how it uses machine learning in a privacy-conscious way.The third episode, Nickelback Apologist Math Bounty is my favourite so far. In it, we answer some quest

It’s fall and you know what that means: new Apple operating systems! When Apple announced macOS Mojave with Dark Mode back in June, we knew we wanted to be there on day one with an update to 1Password that looked great in the dark. So we hiked up our programmer pants and got to work.1Password has a dark sideAs soon as Tim Cook left the stage at the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote we hustled back to our hotel and got to work on some mockups for what a Dark Mode version of 1Password might look like. We started, naturally, with the lock screen:Of course we didn’t stop there. Once you unlock 1Password, you’ll be greeted with a user interface that is right at home in Dark Mode.

California just became the first state to put a cybersecurity law on the books for any internet-connected devices that are made or sold in the state. This new legislation goes into effect January 2020 and is designed to protect consumers by setting higher security standards for smart devices.To comply with this new law, companies will either need to set a unique password for the device at the time of manufacture or prompt people to set a new password during the initial device setup.This is a big step in the right direction for safety and privacy. Too often, people in a rush to get up and running will leave the default password in place rather than taking the time to set a strong password. Unfortunately, the default passwords are trivial to crack.As well as putting our privacy at risk, default passwords make it possible for hackers to take control of thousands of devices at once and use them to bring down other services. Twitter, Spotify, and Reddit have all been attacked in this way.Al

macOS Mojave launched last week, and while Dark Mode was the feature I’d been most eager to test-drive, the redesigned Mac App Store quickly proved to be a dark horse itself. Here’s what I’ve been loving about the new Mac App Store, and what the 1Password team think you’ll love too. ❤️The first voyageThe Mac App Store has never been somewhere I’ve gone to browse, exactly — I’d usually open it with the intent of downloading a specific app. I wasn’t really expecting this to change, and the first time I opened it after upgrading to Mojave I was too struck by how incredible it looked in Dark Mode to notice much else.But after my initial “ooh, Dark Mode!” reaction subsided, I realized it wasn’t just the contrast between the dark backdrop and the rich illustrations that was impressive, but the design of the Mac App Store itself. For the first time ever, the App Store feels like one of the beautifully designed apps you’d go there to purchase — as well as a platform for discovering them.Discov

It’s been a couple of weeks since iOS 12 was released into the wild, and we have loved playing with all the new features it has to offer. Screen Time has shown many of us that we perhaps spend a little too much time on our iPhones, but one thing that has definitely sped up our mobile interactions is Password AutoFill.To recap, Password AutoFill opened up the filling technology included with iOS to third-party developers, meaning that we could make autofilling your passwords even easier.When iOS 12 was announced back in June, we were there in the audience of WWDC, and were thrilled to learn that we could now integrate 1Password directly into iOS. As soon as the keynote was finished, our developers jumped to work, and by dinner we already had a working demo.Skip forward three months and that demo has turned into a fully fledged feature, ready to transform how password filling works on iPhone and iPad.Love and praise from 1Password usersAs soon as our customers began to update their devic

Many banking sites impose password restrictions and security measures that do little to increase user security, while ultimately making it more difficult for users to rely on password managers to fill their complex passwords.These security measures include putting a limit on maximum password length and restricting the ability to paste passwords, with some banks claiming that having to memorize and enter your password regularly makes it more secure. For those of us who rely on 1Password (and other password managers) on a daily basis, this advice is cringe-worthy. Unfortunately, it’s really not all that uncommon in the banking world.We want to help users stay safe with all of their accounts and logins, including banking. The ultimate goal would be to work hand-in-hand with banks and other financial institutions, creating passwords that meet their strict rules, and then keeping those passwords safe.To help achieve that goal, I’ve written an open letter to banks and financial institutions

We recently launched massive updates to 1Password on both Mac and Windows. Today, I’m thrilled to reveal that 1Password is getting a bold new update on the Android platform as well.1Password 7 blends the best features of 1Password with the unique style of Android to deliver the best possible experience for managing your vaults on the go. We started with a design overhaul of the screens you use the most and then packed in some great new functionality to make it easier to access and update your data. On top of the added convenience, we’ve also made it easier to up your security game with some fantastic features I know you’re going to love.Lock it downLet’s start by diving into the first thing that you’ll notice after updating to 1Password 7: the fresh new design.

A while ago, we decided it was time for 1Password to become SOC2 certified… Don’t worry, we aren’t designing socks. Protecting customers’ data has always been our highest priority, and this certification is one more way we can attest to that.SOC stands for Service and Organization Controls, a family of certifications related to others you might have heard of like ISO or FedRAMP. While there are SOC1, SOC2 and SOC3 the one relevant to 1Password is SOC2. Being SOC2 certified means that we’ve demonstrated that we follow best practices for Security and Availability.Security in this case is not about our encryption, which we all know is the best out there. 😉 In the world of SOC2, Security ensures that we have—and follow—processes and policies that keep 1Password secure from all angles- everything from the way we train our employees to how the software is developed. Availability means -you guessed it- that 1Password will be working whenever you need it to.Demonstrating our commitment to sec...

1Password’s Watchtower service has been helping users identify accounts that have been affected by breaches for years.

It can even do this without needing to share your email address with anybody.Before we dive in to learn about the details, take a look at the awesome work Matt and Jasper did to bring this to life.Breach ReportThere’s actually a fair amount to unpack here, and it’s difficult to see detail on a video, so let’s break down the breach report in screenshot form.The Breach Report is split into three sections.The top most section is a list of websites where an account with your email address has been identified as having been compromised, but you don’t have any information about this website in 1Password.That’s amazingly powerful as 1Passw

Hello everyone! It’s WWDC week and a large portion of the 1Password development team is here in San Jose basking in the glow of this year’s Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference. For me it’s my first time coming to WWDC since it was last held in San Francisco two years ago, and I absolutely love it. The conference center itself is gorgeous, and the surrounding area is wonderful. Somehow I’m finding it easier to run into folks I know, and I’ve already caught up with a bunch of old friends and made a number of new ones since I’ve arrived.WWDC is much more than a place for me to stretch the wings of my social butterfly tendencies, however; it’s all about new tech, and boy oh boy did Apple hook us up this year. Many of us are already rocking iOS 12 and macOS Mojave on our main devices and computers and they are awesome. Not only that, but 1Password is running quite happily on iOS 12 and needs just a couple small tweaks on macOS Mojave.iOS 12 and Password AutofillOn Monday afternoon, durin

1Password Business makes it easy to monitor events that happen on your team using the Activity Log, and you can take that to the next level by adding Splunk to the mix. Using the 1Password command-line tool, you can send your team’s 1Password activity to Splunk and keep track of it there alongside other happenings within your team.One of Splunk’s most popular features is the ability to find events and trigger alerts based on them. For example, in your team you could set things up so the sysadmins are alerted whenever someone is added to the Owners group in 1Password.

Just how strong should a 1Password account password be? We recommend that account passwords be generated using our wordlist generator using passwords that are four words long. This gets you something like “napery turnip speed adept”.Among other things, this gives you the chance to learn new words. My dictionary has now informed me that “napery” means household linens such as table cloths and napkins.

Time-based One-Time Passwords is a mouthful, so forgive me for abbreviating it to TOTP from here on out. TOTP is a widely adopted standard and it’s a great way of adding a familiar additional factor to your authentication process.When setting up two-factor authentication, you’ll be provided with a TOTP secret that you can store in an authenticator app of your choosing. 1Password has been a TOTP authenticator for years now and storing it there is very convenien

Last week found a number of us flying out to Toronto for what we called RickConf (I swear I didn’t name it!). The weather did its best to try to get in our way as the ice storm caused some of us to arrive a day later than expected. We all made it though, and I think we all took turns assuring the Californians that this weather is not normal.RickConf was an opportunity for everyone that works on 1Password.com to get together, hang out, and prototype some ideas for the future. 1Password is a remote company, so this is one of the few times per year where the whole team gets together. We think that it’s incredibly important that we get to know each other beyond the avatars we have on Slack.I’d like to introduce you to the team, and help put faces to names you may have seen when emailing in with questions.From left to right we have Jiannine, Jasper, Jacob, Betty, Rob, Meek, Brett, Isha, Connor, Matt, and finally myself.

Since 2015, over 30,000 businesses have signed up for 1Password Teams and discovered how 1Password can help them be secure while also increasing their productivity.We’ve learned a lot by working with these companies and found that what works for a team of 20 doesn’t necessarily work for a company of 20,000. So we got to work.Today, I am thrilled to announce the results of that work: 1Password Business. 🎉1Password Business provides the features you need as a larger team. It gives you the tools to protect your employees, secure your most important data, and stay compliant. Your administrators will love it for the control it gives them, and your employees will love how easy it is to use.Control access and be compliantGDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI, PIPEDA… man, there’re enough compliance requirements to make your head spin.Thankfully, 1Password helps by keeping you in control of who has access to what. Each employee gets a place to store their private, work-related passwords. But there are times...

We all witnessed something refreshing last week when MyFitnessPal announced their data breach. They were open and honest about what happened and they should be congratulated.Many companies hide from the truth and make things much worse for themselves and their customers. Instead, MyFitnessPal did it right. Not only did they handle the disclosure with finesse, they also had excellent systems in place to limit the exposure of the leak.MyFitnessPal provides a great case study on how to handle a data breach and protect customer information. Let’s start with the announcement itself.The AnnouncementFirst it needs to be said that it was awesome that there actually was an announcement and that it was published in a timely manner.

Today we’re celebrating Family Day here in Ontario and throughout other parts of Canada. It’s a great way to remind ourselves of the people in our lives who are always here when we need them. Family can mean a lot of different things – my brother-in-law Mike calling to ask if I need help shovelling snow, my aunt sharing a new card game, or a friend who needs a ride to an appointment – in the end, family means “together”.Sharing togetherMost of the time, sharing lives together is as simple as sharing a meal, sharing how your day was, and – these days – sharing Wi-Fi passwords and Netflix accounts. 1Password Families can’t cook for you or get your kids to clean their rooms, but it’s great with online accounts. In fact, it’s great for sharing a lot more than passwords, too.The Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang got me thinking about international travel, and I’m reminded of Jeff’s post about his son’s trip to Texas.

Tim is also the administrator of our company team on 1Password.com.Tim can script and automate with the best of them, and from the moment he got a preview of op, the DevOps team began bombarding us with feedback. One of the first things he asked for was the ability to create vaults, so we added that right away.

Hello and happy November, everyone! We’ve long anticipated this day here at AgileBits. After months of hard work, 1Password 7 for iOS is now available on iOS 11.The very first step in the journey that brought us to this point was taken back in June, shortly after the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference.

Along the way, we also added a few more features, like support for iPhone X and Face ID, and we’re excited to finally share it all with you.As our release notes say, this is the greatest version of 1Password for iOS we have ever shipped, so let’s dive in, shall we?iPhone X and Face IDOn September 12th, like many of you, everyone here at AgileBits was glued to their screens watching Apple’s keynote from the beautiful Steve Jobs Theater at the new Apple Park campus.

We often get inspired to create new features based on feedback from our customers. Earlier this month, our friends at Basecamp made their Employee Handbook public. We were impressed to see they had a whole section about using 1Password, which included instructions for keeping work information off their devices when travelling internationally.We knew right away that we wanted to make it easier for everyone to follow this great advice. So we hunkered down and built Travel Mode.Travel Mode is a new feature we’re making available to everyone with a 1Password membership. It protects your 1Password data from unwarranted searches when you travel.
