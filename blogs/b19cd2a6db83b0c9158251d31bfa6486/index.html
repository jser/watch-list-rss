2015 was an incredible year to be a web developer, and great year to bebuilding an Ember app.Ember 2.0 landed in August, and with it came the first major shift inapplication architecture since Ember left its SproutCore roots. The Ember-CLIteam made massive improvements to the speed and quality of our build toolingseveral times over, all while continuing to be the foundation for a growingaddon community now topping 2000 projects. Ember-Data stabilized its publicAPI for the first time in the project&#39;s history, and continues to contendfor the title of most complete client-side JavaScript data layer.Other projects, under the official umbrella and outside it, continue toinnovate and mature.With 2015 in the rear-view mirror, we should take a moment to check our assumptionsabout who is in the Ember community and how they work with the framework.To that end, we&#39;re pleased to announcethe official 2016 Ember Community Survey!

The purpose of the Ember Roadmap process is to rally the community around a number of shared goals. This post documents those goals for 2020.Since the Ember community cannot predict the future, we cannot be sure that we will achieve all of the individual items enumerated here. Instead, the purpose of this document is to give the community a common purpose to aspire towards.This year our two headline priorities are:Polish the practical and conceptual details of Octane (tracked properties, Glimmer components, related tooling, accessibility, performance and payload improvements).Make Ember easier to try and adopt, but also lower barriers for Ember developers when collaborating with the greater JavaScript project. We will do this through improvements and simplifications to the framework, and through focused communication with the greater JavaScript community.This document was started in fall 2019.

Back in March, an Accessibility (A11y) Strike Team was formed to address the issues outlined in Ember RFC Issue 595 - Technical Accessibility Issues in New Ember Apps. This blog post is to update the community on that group&#39;s work.The Strike Team met weekly between March 25 and June 24. We even managed to celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day!There were five items listed in Issue 595:Application Language SupportLabel/Input SupportPage Title SupportSupport for ...attributesAccessible Routing SupportActive WorkApplication Language SupportThe goal of application language support was to provide a mechanism for new Ember apps to pass WCAG Success Criteria 3.1.1 - Language of Page. To meet that goal, Joseph Sumner, Jamie White, Ava Wroten and Melanie Sumner authored RFC 635, which proposed a --lang flag for ember-cli. This flag would enable developers to declare the application&#39;s language while they were creating the app, allowing them to more easily meet this particular success crite

Currently, Ember uses release channelsto help users balance between a desire for new features (canary or betachannels) with stability (the release channel). While semver guarantees meanthat upgrades are quite straightforward, some users aren&#39;t able to upgradeevery six weeks. To address these needs,we are announcing a new LTS releasechannel.Ember 2.4 will be the first LTS release of the core framework, and willcontinue every four releases thereafter. Additionally, we&#39;ve updated theemberjs.com/builds page with better guidanceabout when and how to use each of the channels.For our users, LTS releases allow you to upgrade less frequently while stillgetting support from the Ember project and the wider ecosystem.For addon authors, LTS releases allow you to know which versions of Ember tofocus effort on.As a project, Ember will provide security and critical bugfixes for the mostrecent LTS release, in addition to the most recent release (as we do today).We will also avoid breaking heavily used

As of ember-source@4.8.0-beta.2, Ember is shipping a public preview of our official TypeScript support for the framework itself. This is the next step in implementing RFC 0724: Official TypeScript Support and RFC 0800: TypeScript Adoption Plan. Anyone using TypeScript with Ember 4.8.0 Beta 2 or later can opt into using these preview types by removing the corresponding @types packages and adding the following import in your types/&lt;your app&gt;/index.d.ts file:import &#39;ember-source/types&#39;;import &#39;ember-source/types/preview&#39;;This will set your app up to start using Ember&#39;s preview types now and to automatically benefit as we stabilize our types incrementally over the releases ahead. You won&#39;t have to do anything except add these once and then upgrade your app on your normal upgrade cadence!Note that there are some significant changes to these types compared to the types as they exist on DefinitelyTyped today.

We know that building your apps on top of a framework requirestrust, and that trust is never put to the test more than when securityvulnerabilities are discovered.While we&#39;re very fortunate to work on an open source project that runsin a sandboxed environment, the browser, we realize that even JavaScriptapplications can be vulnerable to attacks from malicious third-parties.Ember.js is designed to mitigate common forms of attack. For example,all values rendered using Handlebars are automatically escaped toprevent XSS attacks, and developers must explicitly opt in to outputtingraw HTML.To ensure that Ember applications stay safe, today we&#39;re announcing theEmber.js Security Policy, to help security researchers anddevelopers responsibly disclose potential vulnerabilities in Ember andEmber Data.We have also set up the Ember.js security announcements mailinglist.

In this year&#39;s EmberConf keynote, Yehuda mentioned that we are working on a highly optimized rendering engine for Ember called Glimmer 2.On behalf of all the contributors who have lent a hand along the way, I am very excited to announce that we have released Ember 2.9.0-alpha.1, the first official build with Glimmer 2 included.🔑 A Key Milestone 🔑During the alpha testing period, we will publish new alpha builds on a weekly cadence, following the beta releases schedule. The alpha releases will be cut from the master branch, but with all experimental features other than ember-glimmer stripped from the builds.The purpose of the alpha releases is to enable our community – especially the addon and tooling ecosystem – to start testing the new engine for compatibility and offer feedback. Needless to say, the alpha releases are not intended for production use.To test your apps with the alpha builds, run bower install --save ember#alpha and follow the prompt to persist the resolution.From Embe...

We&#39;re a few weeks away from the release of Ember 1.13 and Ember 2.0 beta, and while there&#39;s been a lot of focus on those releases, the trains will keep rolling on June 12. There will be a 2.1 release 6 weeks hence, and a 2.2 release 6 weeks later.With all of the focus on Ember 2.0, it&#39;s easy to forget that 2.0 is just a six-week release, with the added ability to remove some built-up cruft. Because of the symbolic nature of 2.0, discussions about the future have had an artificial end date of June 12, which is now three weeks away.This post gives some more details about what cruft will be removed in Ember 2.0 and, since the first features in Ember 2.1 will land in three weeks, what we plan to do in the early releases of Ember 2.x.It&#39;s important to note that we&#39;ve talked a lot about an improved &quot;Ember 2 programming model&quot; over the past several months, significantly inspired by React. While much of the model will be in place in Ember 2.0, the early releases of Ember 2.x (especially 2.1 an

The baseURL configuration option and the accompanying &lt;base&gt; tag in Ember CLI applications are often and tragically misunderstood. There have been at least 67 issues opened for Ember CLI referencing baseURL, making it one of the most common points of discussion. As a result, in Ember CLI&#39;s canary channel, we have deprecated baseURL and removed the default &lt;base&gt; inside of index.html. The intent is that this change will be released with Ember CLI 2.7 stable in roughly 10 weeks.Existing applications are able to continue using baseURL with a deprecation warning. If you are eager to adopt this change, you should note that the removal of the &lt;base&gt; tag may impact how your application is deployed, and if so, will likely require some small migration effort, detailed below.This is the culmination of a lot of research and work by Tobias Bieniek and we&#39;re incredibly grateful for his efforts.What was it?baseURL allowed an Ember application and assets to be deployed to a subdirectory without requi

If you&#39;ve been following along, the Ember issues tracker has grown to over 200 active issues. While this is better than some other large OSS projects, it&#39;s still too large for us on the core team to easily keep track of. There are also a number of issues that are over six months old and even a year or two old.Declaring straight-up issue bankruptcy is appealing, but does a disservice to everyone involved. There&#39;s a lot of useful information here for the core team and many of these issues are things we are actively working on solving. So we&#39;re attempting to cut down on the number of issues in a bit more targeted way.In many cases these old issues stuck around because the solution was non-trivial and only a limited set of contributors was qualified to fix them. In some instances, a fix involves considerable internal refactoring that no one has yet had time to do and was hard to justify for one fix.To help keep things manageable, we&#39;ll be consolidating these types of issues into single met

As many of you know, Ember 1.10 will be the first version of Ember that uses HTMLBars as its templating engine. With this change you may need to change the way you compile your templates.The HTMLBars API is evolving and not 1.0.0 yet, so to ensure that templates are compiled compatibly with your Ember version we have updated the Ember build system to generate a ember-template-compiler.js file alongside every build of Ember. This template compiler can be used server-side for precompilation or in the browser to compile templates on the fly. If you do not need to compile templates at runtime (in the browser) the ember.debug.js or ember.prod.js file alone is sufficient. There is no need to include a runtime dependency. This is a departure from previous versions, where you would always include either handlebars.js or handlebars.runtime.js.Most of the time you will use a third party library like ember-cli, ember-cli-htmlbars, or grunt-ember-templates to precompile templates, but this post wi

In fact, Istarted learning about a11y problems through this addon when I added it to a few apps that I was working on when this addon gotreleased back in 2015.While there&#39;s more to building accessible apps than automated tools (like this addon) can help with, it does help ensure thatcommon a11y violations are captured before they can make their way to users.The best part about this addon is that

This is the ninth in our DecEmber series–&quot;Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons&quot;. We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you&#39;ll join us for the fun!Day 9Until recently, converting Ember templates to use Angle Bracket invocation was a tiresome and manual task. With the latest version of ember-angle-brackets-codemod, you get a smarter, more complete codemod to change your templates in a flash!What It DoesBefore Angle Bracket invocation, nearly every template construct in Ember was invoked using Handlebars {{doubleCurly}} syntax. This made differentiating between components, helpers, and plain values incredibly difficult. Angle Brackets alleviate most of this ambiguity. But what if you wanted to change every double curly component invocation to Angle Brackets? That task could take forever (especially if you cant reliably tell the difference between everything in your templates)! The Angle Bracket Codemod eases the transition in a few steps:I

We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you&#39;ll join us for the fun!Day 6Once upon a time, if Ember developers wanted to use a regular npm package, they needed to jump through some hoops, but ember-auto-import makes it a breeze!What It DoesThe ember-auto-import addon provides a zero-config way to use npm packages in your Ember app, and even lazy-load them.Why I Like ItOne of my wishes for the web is that we can make it easier for new people to learn, participate, and build.Whenever I see this trend happening in Ember, it makes me happy.I love this addon because it eliminates the need for a beginner (and experienced developer) to understand the differences between AMD and CJS modules, and how they get into the app tree.They don&#39;t need to read about how to configure their build.They don&#39;t need to know how Ember&#39;s build pipeline differs from other build tools.The

This addon provides a native Ember component library for some of the more commonly used Bootstrap components.The ember-bootstrap addon can help you can integrate Bootstrap into your application quickly, and in an idiomatic Ember manner.There are many related Ember addons that integrate with Ember Bootstrap to provide additional features on top of Ember Bootstrap, such as form validation and changesets.Ember Bootstrap - Why I Like ItIf you&#39;re looking to add Bootstrap to an Ember application, ember-bootstrap makes doing so incredib

As a result, we have borrowed concepts from the Elixir community to give you the ability to prevent mutating the underlying object until the last possible moment when you have decided to apply the changes and the data is valid. This functional approach to validations has proved to be quite useful.This addon works in conjunction with ember-changeset-validations to provide you with out of the box validations to validate the format of a certain input, ensure passwords pass a minimum security threshold or even let you build your own custom validator!Why I Like ItRecently I rewrote ember-changeset to fix long outstanding bugs,

For good reason, too. It&#39;s well-supported by the addon maintainers, there&#39;s a dedicated documentation site, and there&#39;s support on the Ember Community Discord server in the #ec-mirage channel.&quot;It’s a part of the ecosystem I dearly miss when I work with other frameworks.&quot;As an extra bonus, EmberMap has generously made their

It&#39;s that amazing / critical / &#92;&lt;add your hype word of choice here&gt;!In all seriousness, let me tell you why I love Sass and why I encourage you to try out ember-cli-sass today.What It Doesember-cli-sass uses Sass to preprocess stylesheets in your Ember app (or addon).

This includes not only configuring Babel to handle TypeScript, but build-time type-checking, in-browser type error reporting, and a whole set of custom blueprints for generating TypeScript versions of everything from routes and controllers to services to components. ember-cli-typescript also helps addon authors write their addons in TypeScript by handling automatic precompilation and type definition generation when publishing.Why I Like ItStatic typing is a lifesaver, especially in ambitious apps with complex structures and many moving parts.

Now, I&#39;m glad that I did. This addon surfaced in 2015, has received regular updates, and powers many of my favorite addons. (Can you guess how?)What It Doesember-code-snippet lets you render code snippets in your app (or addon). Quite handy if you want to create a technical blog or document your components.It provides a helper called get-code-snippet so that (1) you can save code snippets in a dedicated folder and (2) create your own component to customize their look.To illustrate the use, we&#39;ll consider a code snippet from the Ember.js Octane vs Classic Cheat Sheet:// my-app-name/snippets/make-your-own-elementId.jsimport Component from &#39;@glimmer/component&#39;;import { guidFor } from &#39;@ember/object/intern

Useful helpers (like filter-by, repeat, and group-by, to name a few. These helpers can be used together (imagine using group-by in conjunction with filter-by…go ahead, imagine it, I&#39;ll wait…).The declarative bit means that we&#39;re telling our template what we want to do, succinctly; ember-composable-helpers tells our app how to do it, saving us time and increasing our productivity.Why I Like ItI think this addon is the bee&#39;s

We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you&#39;ll join us for the fun!Day 5Let&#39;s talk about ember-concurrency.The experience is part joy, part tragedy.The joy comes from having elegant, straightforward solutions for things like debouncing.The tragedy is that I have to write this code myself when I am working in a non-Ember setting, but I suppose absence makes the heart grow fonder.What It DoesThe ember-concurrency addon helps you &quot;write concise, robust, and beautiful asynchronous code.&quot; For example, think about what should happen if a user rapidly clicks a &quot;submit&quot; button. With this addon, there&#39;s a nice way to prevent 30 form submissions.Or, what if an API request takes a long time, and you want to be able to cancel it? Promises won&#39;t help you, but ember-concurrency tasks will.Why I Like ItWithout ember-concurrency, it would take a lot of effort to manage starti

The ember-css-modules addon helps us to co-locate css files next to our components, routes and controllers following Ember&#39;s file name conventions.Why I Like ItMaking the apps we are building look awesome can be really fun! But maintaining a growing CSS code base can also be really hard. CSS Modules are a great way to modularise our styles in a way that they apply locally to only the exact component or route we wrote them for by default.

It extends from the default Ember CLI test command, allowing you run it as you would ember test.Why I Like Itember-exam allows us to run tests in parallel which can greatly reduce the overall run time of our test suite.

It mirrors Ember&#39;s helper API, and has forms for writing both simple functional modifiers and more complicated class modifiers.A modifier can add customized, automatic behavior to a DOM element, such as tracking scroll position or adding new event listeners. After you write a modifier, you can use it in a template like this:&lt;div {{my-modifier}}&gt; Some more content&lt;/div&gt;Developers who have tried out the Octane preview might already be familiar with ember-render-modifiers, which provide some modifiers like {{did-insert}} out of the box.

The title of each Web page should:Identify the subject of the Web pageMake sense when read out of context, for example by a screen reader or in a site map or list of search resultsBe shortWhy I Like ItThanks to ember-page-title, you can provide users with an HTML browser title tag so they know where they are within your single-page application (SPA).How to use it:Run ember install ember-page-titleAdd {{head-layout}} to your application.hbs fileInclude the title helper to each page

We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you&#39;ll join us for the fun!Day 14Today&#39;s selection for &#39;31 Days of Ember Addons&#39; is ember-power-select.What It DoesEmber Power Select provides a powerful select component, built from the ground up for Ember so that it works the way you expect an addon to work in Ember. Exceptionally well-documented, Ember Power Select allows you to create everything from a straightforward list of text items to an asynchronous search driven select which incorporates graphical elements in the list.The addon&#39;s website includes a cookbook for more unusual requirements as well as a list of community provided addons which address functionality outside of the scope of Ember Power Select.Why I Like ItI have grown to love using Ember Power Select while developing a CRUD-rich web app which benefits from many instances of select elements dr

We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you&#39;ll join us for the fun!Day 13Today we&#39;re going to look at ember-simple-auth!What It DoesThe ember-simple-auth addon is a lightweight library that helps you implement authentication and authorization in your Ember applications. It takes care of maintaining a client side session and synchronizing it accross tabs and windows, so you don&#39;t have to worry about your user signing out in one tab and remaining signed in in others.It comes with a set of authentication providers (OAuth, Device, Torri) and can be customized in case you need to support a different authentication mechanism. It also provides a session service and a series of mixins that will aid you in adding authorization information to your requests, defining which routes should be accessible only to signed in users, and controlling the user session.Why I

We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you&#39;ll join us for the fun!Day 1To kick things off, we&#39;re going to look at ember-sortable.What It DoesThe ember-sortable addon provides sortable UI primitives for Ember apps- this is super useful in the sense that teams don&#39;t have to reinvent this very common pattern every time they need it for their own applications!Why I Like ItWhile the ember-sortable addon has been around for some time now, providing a consistent way to add drag and drop functionality to an Ember app, it is the most recent additions that have made this addon especially worth paying attention to. Yicheng Gong, a software engineer at LinkedIn, noticed that the addon was missing accessibility support. He took on the work via the Adopted Ember Addons org, and updated the addon to add the missing features!The addon now provides a keyboard-only way to sor

Today, we look at a useful addon he wrote to help make debugging a little simpler - ember-template-invocation-location.What It DoesThe ember-template-invocation-location addon will allow you to debug things such as the location in a template that a given helper, component, or modifier was invoked from; the invocation site of the thing that invoked that template, and so on up to the root most template (generally a route template). Since this is primarily done in development and test builds, it will not work in production by default.The general goal of this addon is to enable significantly easier debugging. As a result of this, it is expected that the majority of

We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you&#39;ll join us for the fun!Day 19Today we are going to look at an addon that is part of every new Ember app. The ember-template-lint addon has many new features added recently, and is worth a close look!What It DoesAs you may guess from the addon title, ember-template-lint is a linter for your template files!It checks for mistakes and advises best practices for the markdown in your component and route templates.Because we work in JavaScript, there are different ways something could be done, but often there is an ideal solution that avoids problems down the line.This is where ember-template-lint shines. It will throw warnings and/or errors when you try to break one of these rules.It&#39;s extendable and customizable too, so you can get the right combination of rules for your project.Why I Like ItThe ember-template-lint addon

Our December series - &quot;Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons&quot; aims to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you enjoy hearing about addons that bring us joy as well!Day 15On the 15th day of our Countdown to The New Year we want to take a look at a helpful Ember addon which lets us write redesign-proof tests: ember-test-selectors!What It Doesember-test-selectors is an addon that allows us to use additional, test-specific markup in the form of data-test attributes in the dev and test environments of our app. This additional, test-specific markup allows us to select elements in our integration and application tests reliably - even if the HTML markup or CSS selectors change during a redesign of our app.The addon takes care of removing data-test attributes from our production builds automatically, freeing us from the worry that our bundle size might increase as we build and test away.Why I Like ItIf we only rely on CSS selectors or HTML markup to find e

In &quot;Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons&quot; we highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you&#39;ll join us for the fun!Day 4Today we are going to take a look at ember-tether.What It DoesThe addon ember-tether provides us with a UI component that - once rendered - will render its block to any other target DOM node on the page as configured via the component&#39;s attributes. This &quot;tethering&quot; of the component&#39;s block to a target somewhere else on the page also retains the component&#39;s context - making Ember action handling and data binding possible.Why I Like ItEven though we have a lot of control over how and where Ember apps render UI using routes and components, it&#39;s sometimes difficult to implement less conventional UI patterns such as interactive modal dialogs or tooltips for street maps without writing lots of boilerplate. I enjoy using ember-tether for giving me the freedom to render app content where

This is the last of our December series-&quot;Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons&quot;. Thank you for joining us!What a month it’s been! Over the last thirty days, we have showcased different kinds of addons in the Ember ecosystem. In this final post, we’ll show how an Ember app’s default addons come together to form a great developer experience, and we will reflect on the article series as a whole.This article series highlights the real spirit of the Ember community, the ways in which we come together to find a way to say yes to good ideas. It started out as a wish: “Wouldn’t it be nice if we had our own advent calendar blog?” Then, it quickly turned into a refined possibility: “Let’s do a countdown to the new year so we can cover more addons.” From there, it grew into actionable steps: “What does an MVP blog post look like? How about a pre-determined format to make it easier to allow other community members to contribute?” This is one example of how many of our favorite open so

The ember-svg-jar addon enables you to effortlessly use SVG images in Ember apps.Why We Like ItA common theme in the Ember community is zero configuration. In that vein, with ember-svg-jar, you get a visual workflow out of the box to search and preview icons in one place. Check out the live demo and empower your team with this feature!The ember-svg-jar addon helps you reduce the size of your assets. Using svgo, SVGs are automatically optimized, which can cut your file size by half or more. So useful!The addon is flexible and extensible. ember-svg-jar provides an easy-to-use helper {{svg-jar &quot;asset-name&quot;}}, support for both inline and symbol embedding methods, and the

Ember 1.0 Prerelease 2 is out now. This is mainly a bug fix releaseafter 1.0.pre. However, there are a few things you should be aware ofand we&#39;ll go over those a bit below. We&#39;re still pushing hard toward the a 1.0 beta release but wanted to make some of our bug fixes available in a more formal way. If you want to go ahead anddownload now, you can grab it over on the Github Download Page. What&#39;s Changed NowOther than bug fixes, there are a few things we&#39;ve changed thatcould affect your 1.0.pre apps.{{outlet}} now creates a Metamorph rather than a &lt;div&gt;. This makesit less obtrusive, but you may have to change your HTML or CSS if youwere relying on the &lt;div&gt;.We have removed CP_DEFAULT_CACHEABLE and VIEW_PRESERVES_CONTEXTflags.

Here&#39;s the thing about ambitious apps: they usually have state.Lots of state. And the bigger your app gets, the harder keeping allof it in your head becomes.Part of being an app on the web is taking advantages of the browser&#39;sstrengths. In particular, the fact that we have URLs to describe whatwe see on our screen is an advantage over native applications. Yourusers want to be able to share that URL on Twitter or Facebook and have their friends see what they&#39;re seeing.Ember 1.0 Prerelease includes what we think is the most advanced toolfor modeling your application&#39;s state: Ember.Router.

Today at Ember Camp, we announced the release of Ember.js 1.0 RC1.This release is all about fixing bugs from the pre4 release, andgets us that much closer to a final 1.0 release. Between this releaseand the 1.0 final, we will mostly be focusing on stability and documentation.If you discover any blocking bugs or undocumented areas, please file tickets atthe emberjs/ember.js repo on GitHub and consider helping out.Route ReplacementYou can now transition to a new route without creating an entry in the history:// instead of this, which creates a history entryrouter.transitionTo(&#39;index&#39;);// do thisrouter.replaceWith(&#39;index&#39;);In the redirect hook, you can use replaceWith and Ember won&#39;t createa history entry.In a controller, you can use replaceRoute (instead of transitionToRoute)to do the same thing.Item ControllerIf you want every item in a {{#each}} to be wrapped in an ObjectController,you can do so:{{#each posts itemController=&quot;post&quot;}} {{!-- `this` in here is each post wrapped in an App.P

Today, we&#39;re releasing the second Release Candidate of Ember 1.0.As we said when we released RC1, the next few releases will beabout bugfixes and improvements, and should not have any breakingchanges.Namespace Lookup for ControllersIt is now possible to look up controllers that are included in anamespace other than the main application namespace.For example, when using the render helper:{{render &#39;posts&#39;}}This will render the posts template with the controller App.PostsController, where App is the main application namespace.If you want to use an alternative namespace, you can use a/-separated path.{{render &#39;blog/posts&#39;}}This will render the blog/posts template with the controllerBlog.PostsController.Using Render With Multiple ModelsIn RC1, you could use {{render &#39;posts&#39;}} to render the poststemplate using the app&#39;s instance of App.PostsController.

So, forexample, if you have this route:App.PhotosRoute = Ember.Route.extend({ model: function() { return App.Photo.find(); }});The array returned from model would be set as the model property ofthe App.PhotosController. This tells the controller that it shouldpresent that model

Ember.js 1.0 RC5 has been released and is now available from themain website as well as builds.emberjs.com.RC5 fixes several regressions and bugs found in RC4. Notably:A performance regression caused by a change to run loop scheduling hasbeen fixed. Thanks to Erik Bryn forworking on this.Promises returned from a route&#39;s model hook could cause the app tohang on page refresh. This has been fixed thanks to Alex Matchneer.The ember-testing package, which contains additional helpers fortesting Ember.js apps, is no longer included in the production build.This means less JavaScript for end users to load over the network.Thank you to everyone who filed issues and pull requests. Please try outRC5 in your applications and report any issues or regressions you findby filing an issue on GitHub.Lastly, thanks to Stefan Penner, whohas been busting his tail to get Ember.js to the 1.0 finish line,including doing the release engineering for these release candidates.Thanks Stef!</div><div

The second was spotty async support which made it difficult toprevent or delay route entry in cases such as authentication and async code-loading.We have now harmonized URL changes and transitionTo semantics and more fully embracedasynchrony using promises.Additionally, router transitions have become first-class citizens and there arenew hooks to prevent or decorate transitions:willTransition: fires on current routes whenever a transition is about to take place beforeModel/model/afterModel: hooks fired during the async validation phaseFinally there is an error event which fires whenever there is a rejected promise orerror thro

We’re pleased to announce the release of Ember 1.0 RC7 today! If all goes smoothly, this will be our penultimate RC before Ember 1.0. This release includes a number of bug fixes and a few small improvements. We’ve got a few other bug fixes in the queue that weren’t quite ready but this release was overdue and we didn’t want to wait. To that end, we expect to release RC8 next week. Read on for more details on what we changed.Important ChangesRoute#controllerFor no longer auto generates controllersIn some cases, people have been relying on controllerFor to access controllers for routes that have not yet been entered, relying on its auto-generation ability. Unfortunately, this can actually lead to subtle bugs. When entering a route, Ember looks for a controller with a matching name. If that controller isn’t found, Ember generates one according to the type of the route’s model. If the model is an array, we generate an ArrayController; if it’s an object, an ObjectController; if neither, a s

With Ember 1.0 RC8, we have reached the final RC before 1.0 final, whichwe hope to release this weekend if all goes well.This final release candidate comes with a couple of small breakingchanges that we are making before 1.0 because they should have a smallimpact on application code but a large impact on performance.We normally would not make changes of this nature this close to the 1.0final release date. However, the performance improvements were sodramatic we did not want to wait until Ember.js 2.0 to introduce thechange, and we are serious in our commitment to not breaking the APIpost-1.0. This was our last chance to get these changes in beforeputting the final stamp on the 1.0.Both of the changes are related to observers. If you find yourselfwriting code with lots of observers, you may be writing non-idiomaticcode. In general, you should only need to use observers when you arebridging Ember code to other libraries that do not support bindings orcomputed properties.For example, if y

Today, we&#39;re excited to announce the final release of Ember.js 1.0.The first commit to the repository that would become Ember.js happened on April30th, 2011, almost two and a half years ago.At the time, Backbone.js was rocketing to popularity. In response to largeJavaScript frameworks like SproutCore, Cappuccino, and Dojo, which tried toabstract away HTML, most web developers began rejecting any solution whosesource code they couldn&#39;t read over in an afternoon. The &quot;microlibrary&quot; frenzyhad hit full tilt.However, we knew that as web browsers became more and more powerful, thesesimplistic abstractions wouldn&#39;t scale up to the kind of apps that users wouldbegin to demand.We realized that helping developers grapple with the complexity of building100% JavaScript web applications could only happen if we embraced the toolsthat they were most comfortable with: HTML and CSS.Based on the current popularity of frameworks like Ember, Angular and Knockout,it&#39;s clear that this strategy turned out to

Today we are releasing Ember.js 1.11.1, a patch-level release of Ember thatfixes several regressions introduced in the 1.11.0 release.CollectionView with attributeBindingsDuring the 1.11.0 cycle much effort was put into making sure that attributeBindings usedthe same logic that template bound attributes use. Namely, that attributeBindings useHTMLBars&#39; attribute helpers instead of jQuery&#39;s.Unfortunately, this work lead to an error when CollectionView instances were used withattributeBindings specified. This regression is fixed in 1.11.1.Invalid URLsRefactoring in the router initialization process lead to a bug that caused the browsers URLto become out of sync with the correct URL when the back button was pressed while usingHistoryLocation.This regression is fixed in 1.11.1.Handlebars Helper IssuesA couple regressions were fixed for Handlebars helpers with 1.11.1:The inverse template (aka {{else}} block) of Handlebars helpers was not properly accountedfor during the HTMLBars transition.

We are pleased to announce that both Ember.js 1.6.0 and the first beta in the 1.7 serieshave been released. This comes as the sixth cycle of our release process that began after 1.0 was released.Delays DetailedAs many of you know, the 1.6 release is the first to be published after converting thecodebase to ES6 modules. The 1.6+ builds are now transpiled by the es6-module-transpilerinto AMD and use a small AMD loader to handleloading the transpiled modules. Unfortunately, adding the additional loader overhead onboot has a fairly significant performance impact on boot speed of older mobile clients(approximately 5-10% boot time penalty).This regression was brought to our attention before 1.6.0 was intended to ship (lateMay), and we decided to hold the release until a fix could be applied. In retrospect thiswas absolutely the wrong decision. The fix has taken much longer than originally anticipatedand in the meantime folks are stuck with 1.5.1.

What is it like to build an accessible Ember app? With a few lines of code, you can audit your app for problems, get customized advice on how to fix them, and see visual indications of which things on a page need work. We&#39;ll walk through an example using the Super Rentals app from Ember&#39;s official tutorials. We&#39;ll also cover some improvements being made to Ember itself for a better experience out of the box.An accessible app is one that gives all users equal access to information and functionality, including those who use Assistive Technology like screen readers.

What an incredible time to be in the Ember Community!Ember.js completed seven backward-compatible minor version releases in the last year.An amazing 200+ community members contributed to core Ember projects (that&#39;s not even counting the 4500+ ember addons!)Over 3,000 community members have joined the Ember Discord chat.An Ember documentary was released, looking at Ember&#39;s history…and Ember&#39;s bright future.With 2019 already under way, we would like your help to learn about who is in the Ember community and how they work with the framework. To that end, we&#39;re pleased to announce the official 2019 Ember Community Survey. Survey Landing PageThis is the fifth year we&#39;re learning about the community&#39;s makeup and interests, and we look forward to sharing the results at EmberConf 2019 on March 18th. Over 1300 participants took part in the survey in 2018 (2018 survey results) and we are aiming for even more participation this year!Completing the survey should take about 15 minutes.

Today, we are pleased to announce the release of Ember Data 0.13.Ember Data 0.13 is the first official release of Ember Data. This shouldmake it easier for people to synchronize Ember.js and Ember Dataversions, and make reasoning about the upgrade process much easier.Ember Data 0.13In the past few months, Ember Data has stabilized a lot. We still considerit alpha, and recommend it for production use only to those who like tolive on the bleeding edge and contribute back to the project. To make lifeeasier for those folks, though, we will be cutting regular releases like wedo with Ember.js.A few of the many folks involved in the changes in this release includeTom Dale, Yehuda Katz, Cyril Fluck, Igor Terzic, Stefan Penner, Paul Chavard,Gordon Hempton, Peter Wagenet.

New Core ContributorsLong-time contributors Brendan McLoughlin and Sylvain Minahave been given collaborator status and will help us triage issues, merge pullrequests, and contribute bugfixes and documentation.New Featuresstore.fetchWhen using Ember Data, the most common pattern in the model hook is to callstore.find for your model:export default var PostRoute = Ember.Route.extend({ model: function(params) { return this.store.find(&#39;post&#39;, params.post_id); }});store.find will return the instance of the Post record if it has alreadybeen fetched in the store. Sometimes, this is not desirable. For example, youmay not know if you have already loaded the post in another request viasideloading, or you want the most up to date information. You could eithercheck if the record existed usingstore.hasRecordForId, or always callreload on your model in the route&#39;s afterModelhook.store.fetch wraps this common pattern by reloading a record if it exists inthe store, or reloads the record if it doesn&#39;t e

This resulted in confusion becauseupdating ember-data in package.json would not update ember-datain bower.json.To upgrade Ember Data to version 2.3 in your Ember CLI projects pleasedo the following:remove the ember-data package from your bower.jsonupdate ember-cli-shims package to version 0.1.0 ... &quot;dependencies&quot;: { &quot;handlebars&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;, &quot;ember&quot;: &quot;~2.2.0&quot;,- &quot;ember-cli-shims&quot;: &quot;0.0.6&quot;,+ &quot;ember-cli-shims&quot;: &quot;0.1.0&quot;, &quot;ember-cli-test-loader&quot;: &quot;ember-cli-t

EmberData 4.12 Special LTS UpdateIn our 5.0 Announcement we promised extended support for 4.12 LTS beyond just bug fixes.This support extends beyond simple bug-fixes. If minor enhancements can be made to better support new presentation class implementations that support the 4.x series we will willingly accept them. Our goal is simple: we want no one left behind.To this end, here are the changes we currently plan to make for 4.12 to ensure our users can both upgrade to 4.12 from 4.6 and 4.11 more seamlessly and to provide additional tools for users on 4.12 to begin shifting to the RequestManager paradigm as early as possible for their app.Builders and Build utilsThe first LTS release of @ember-data/rest and @ember-data/active-record will have their peer-dependency supported versions set to include ~4.12.3 of @ember-data/store.Once apps have updated from 4.12 to the 5.x LTS they should use the associated release&#39;s version to ensure maximum inter-compatibility.@ember-data/request-utils ha

This week, in coordination with the broader Ember project, EmberData released 4.12, its final4.x version, and began iterating towards the first release of the 5.x series.A wrap on 4.xThis final release of the 4.x cycle introduced several new concepts to support a new paradigm for managing Requests and new capabilities for Caching Data.The primary focus of these changes was to support caching Documents and to ensure that Resources are handled opaquely. Loosely defined: A Document encompasses the full response returned by an API request, and can typically be identified uniquely by url. Documents may contain many resources or references to resources, where a resource is defined as some data which your application or the API treats as uniquely identifiable.Note: Historically, Model has mapped to a resource &quot;type&quot; and serves to present the data for a resource. It may be useful to think about resources as the backing data for a Model; however, resources can be far more generic than this and

While working on it, there were several issues raised, including the problem ofhow to make sure that mixins that extend the JSON Serializer(Embedded records mixin right now, and Sideloading mixin in the future) have theirhooks called in the right order and that they do not interfere with each other.Decided that the refactor into a mixin is a good idea.Tom raised the idea of having a serialization pipeline, but we decided to punt on that for now.Decided to wait on more use cases before deciding whether/and how to reorganize

We are thrilled to share that we have released Ember FastBoot 1.0 (including ember-cli-fastboot addon, fastboot-app-server and other FastBoot libraries).What is Ember FastBoot?Ember FastBoot is a server-side rendering solution for ambitious Ember apps,allowing your Ember apps to use principles of progressive enhancement, such as an initial render of your app without JavaScript.It provides a complete solution for server-side rendering of your app from development to deployment.FastBoot works by running your Ember app in Node and shipping the rendered HTML of your initial requested route in your index.html (which also contains scripts for your app to boot in browser) to the user.This helps you show meaningful content to your user while the JavaScript is being downloaded, and also helps the initial page of your app to paint faster.Once the JavaScript downloads and your Ember app in the browser boots, it takes over the initial rendered HTML.It also helps the content in your Ember applicati

The road to Ember 2.0 has been long and rewarding: the community and team have invested in huge efforts to move Ember to a component-based architecture; we released a stable Ember Data; and we unified our development process with Ember CLI. All in all, we&#39;ve made huge progress.Unfortunately, our docs efforts haven’t kept up with all of those improvements. We know that many Ember users have been frustrated that they can&#39;t find the resources they need to take advantage of new features.Over the next few releases, we&#39;ll be focusing on major improvements to the content of the Ember Guides and the process of landing new features so we don&#39;t fall behind again.Upcoming releasesHere&#39;s what you can expect in the coming weeks and months:Ember Data: Several of us are working hard to update the Models section of the Guides to properly document Ember Data in its stable form.

Ember is committed to being a good steward of our collective codebases as part of the Node.js ecosystem. In that spirit we will be following the Node.js Long Term Support Schedule to provide clear guarantees of which versions of Node.js we support and how long we will support them. We will test against the same set of releases which the Node.js Long-term Support Working Group says they support: any &quot;Current&quot;, &quot;Active LTS&quot;, or &quot;Maintenance&quot; releases.What does support mean?All Ember projects can be expected to work in any of the supported Node.js versions and will support every documented feature. We will not maintain separate branches or classes of support for different Node.js support classifications. For example, Ember CLI can be expected to work the same running on a &quot;Maintenance&quot; Node.js version as it does on a &quot;Current&quot; Node.js version. Not all of our projects presently align to this pattern but we will, over time, coalesce to this state.Meeting this commitment does not come withou

Ember.js (or should we say Amber.js) turned five years old last December. In some ways, five years is a short amount of time. But when measured in web framework years, it feels like a downright eternity.As Yehuda and I were getting ready for our keynote presentation at this year&#39;s EmberConf, we tried to remember what developing web apps was really like in 2011. We knew that the web had changed for the better since then, but I think we both had repressed our memories of how truly awful it was.The Web in 2011The most popular browser in 2011, by a wide margin, was IE8. Today, for most people, IE8 is a distant, half-remembered nightmare.Today, we freely use new language features like async functions, destructuring assignment, classes, and arrow functions. We even get to use not-quite-standardized features like decorators ahead of time thanks to transpilers like Babel and TypeScript. In 2011, however, everyone was writing ES3. ES5 was considered too &quot;cutting edge&quot; for most people to adopt.D

We recently made a significant shift in how we think about versioning in Ember, with RFC 0830: Evolving Ember’s Major Version Process. Starting in the current 4.0 cycle, Ember major versions will be 18 months long, running from the .0 release up to the .12 release, and then starting a new major version.For example, in the current 4.x cycle, we will do minor releases up through 4.12 in April 2023, and then release 5.0 in May 2023. Then we will repeat, with 5.12 arriving in September 2024 and 6.0 coming in November 2024.This is a pretty significant change, so it’s important to say up front the things that aren’t changing:Our approach to minor releases is not changing. We will keep releasing on the same steady cadence. Features will be in, or not, based on whether they’re ready.Our approach to Long Term Support releases is not changing. That means that every major version will have 3 LTS releases over its life: the .4, .8 and .12 releases. Having a minimum of 3 LTS releases is important t

As we join Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) in celebrating its tenth anniversary, we are delighted to announce that the Ember JavaScript Framework has taken the GAAD pledge to make accessibility a core value of our framework.For those who know the project well, this will come as no surprise. It’s no secret that we think that accessibility is an integral part of quality code. Ember.js is committed to providing a well-lit path for developer success, and our plans to make it easier for developers to write accessible code are part of that. In 2020, the Ember Accessibility Strike Team became the Ember Accessibility Working Group, demonstrating our commitment to long-term accessibility growth in the framework.What We&#39;ve Done So FarEmber has also been shipping improvements with the “accessibility by default” developer experience in mind. These improvements include support for default app language (RFC #635), default page titles (RFC #645), added content to the guides specifically for

As we celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), I also want to take the time to celebrate the incredible progress that the Ember community has made in our accessibility (a11y) efforts. Over the past few years, the Ember community has been purposefully strategic about accessibility improvements; it hardly came as a surprise that we made our commitment to accessibility even more visible by taking the GAAD Pledge last year to make accessibility a core value of our framework.Getting Started: Setting GoalsAfter completing an analysis of the accessibility-related shortcomings shared both across all JS Frameworks and in Ember specifically, a tangible list of items that could be improved emerged. It was also clear that additional education of the community was needed to increase mindshare regarding accessiblilty in general.Of course, there is a forever-long list of accessibility improvements to be made across the web; to avoid trying to boil the proverbial ocean, it was important to

After months of work, Glimmer is landing in Canary today.What this means:The test suite passes.We have tested Glimmer on our own apps, and, for the most part, apps boot andrun correctly.There are still known issues (see below), including with the test helpers.At this point, we need community help to identify compatibility issues notcovered by the test suite.We expect to continue improving compatibility with the pre-Glimmer engine forsome time, as new issues come to light.Glimmer is the new rendering engine the Ember community has been working on forthe past several months. It is the first ground-up change to the templatingengine since SproutCore 2.0, and takes advantage of the groundwork laid byHTMLBars to dramatically improve re-rendering performance. It also sets thestage for more performance improvements during the 2.x series, andReact-inspired improvements to the Ember programming model.

At EmberConf in March of this year, we announced Glimmer.js, alibrary for building modern UI components optimized for the mobile web. I wantedto give an update on what we&#39;ve been working on since then.There were two primary motivations for releasing Glimmer.js as a standalone project:We wanted people who aren&#39;t &quot;all in&quot; on Ember to have a way to incrementallyadopt part of the framework.We wanted a laboratory where we could freely run experiments on what anext-generation component library might look like, without creating churn forEmber users.Because Ember&#39;s rendering layer is built on top of the shared Glimmer VM,successful experiments have a clear path to make their way upstream to Emberusers. And, once stabilized, we&#39;d like Glimmer.js to be the default componentAPI for new Ember apps—but it&#39;s still too premature to set any timelines forthat today.Unlocking ExperimentationWhile Ember is known for incorporating the best ideas from across the JavaScriptecosystem, it&#39;s important that we

On its own, however, TypeScript can&#39;t see what&#39;s happening in yourtemplates, so any typechecking or other helpful aids it provides can only ever operate uponsmall islands of disconnected code, and all of your connections are completely opaque to thetooling.Glint enables TypeScript to understand your templates as well, meaning you getend-to-end type safety for your entire application.

IntroductionAt the time of this writing, this feature is available in ember-template-lint@3.0.0-beta.3.The new todo feature in the ember-template-lint addon provides a new option to the existing states for linting rules.With this new functionality, linting issues can be converted into a todo and developers can strategically plan the work to resolve issues in existing code. A todo can be set to automatically become a warning, then an error with the use of a supporting feature called decay days.Previously, running the lint:hbs script (default in an Ember app) would cause ember-template-lint to run on all of the .hbs files, and return a result that included number of warnings and number of errors found.Now, however, we have a new option—we can also include number of todos. First, update the lint:hbs script in the package.json file to use the --include-todo flag (we want to be reminded that we have todos!):&quot;lint:hbs&quot;: &quot;ember-template-lint . --include-todo&quot;,Next, run the command yarn lint:h

As Ember Data is more than ever a core part of the Emberexperience, we&#39;re looking forward to even tighter coordination betweenthe two projects.You can follow Igor on Twitter ifyou&#39;d like to keep tabs as he travels the world. Thank you, Igor, forall of your hard work, and welcome to the core team!</div><div class="ui-feed-item__date" title="2014-11-16 00:00:00">10年前</div></div></div><div

The Ember project is pleased to announce that an improved RFC (&quot;request for comments&quot;) process has been implemented.As proposed in RFC #617 &quot;RFC Stages&quot;, RFCs will now progress through several stages that now include tracking implementation, release, and completeness of features, as well as design:0 - ProposedA new proposal for a change to Ember or its processes that is offered for community and team evaluation. In practical terms, this is an open pull request on the emberjs/rfcs repo.1 - ExploringAn RFC deemed worth pursuing but in need of refinement. This stage is marked by labeling the opened PR as &#39;Exploring&#39;.2 - AcceptedA fully specified RFC. Waiting for or in the process of implementation. An FCP is required to advance to this stage. This stage is marked by updated frontmatter in the text of the RFC and by being merged to the main branch of the emberjs/rfcs repo.

As we announced in the inaugural blog post in our Inside FastBootseries, wehave begun working on giving Ember.js developers the ability to runtheir apps in Node.js. Once complete, this feature will allow your usersto see HTML and CSS right away, with the JavaScript downloadingin the background and taking over once it has fully loaded.Before the holidays, we had already succeeded in getting the Ember.jsframework loading in Node.js (where it cannot rely on things like theDOM) without throwing any exceptions. We also were able to get Emberapps booting, parsing URLs, and completing most of the functionalitynecessary to start the app, including loading controllers, routes andmodels, etc.This week, we&#39;ve made good progress on the next major piece offunctionality: allowing HTMLbars templates to render in Node.js where,again, there is no native DOM available.So how does HTMLbars, a DOM-based templating library, work in anenvironment without a DOM?As it turns out, we can introduce a &quot;virtual DO

Using JavaScript to write fast, interactive web applications has exploded in popularity over the past few years. JavaScript apps offer many strengths over traditional server-rendered applications. Most notably, rich interactions and lightning-fast responses to user clicks allow for UIs that previously were only the domain of native apps.The first JavaScript-heavy applications were productivity apps, and the experience of loading an app on the web, even with a spinner, was far better than the equivalent experience of downloading and installing a native app.Increasingly, though, content-rich destinations such as news or video sites are starting to move to JavaScript to gain the benefits of improved interactivity. Unlike productivity apps, where the user logs in once at the beginning of the day and stays logged in, content sites are loaded many times per day, often via search engines or social sharing.In this context, where the JavaScript app looks like a &quot;normal&quot; web page, loading spinne

Over the last few years the Ember project and community have grown, and along with it, the Ember brand. We took care and caution to craft an experience and feel that while exciting and ambitious, stayed friendly and approachable. A big part of that is thanks to our friendly neighborhood mascot, the Tomster.The time has come to expand the family. Introducing Zoey.When chatting about the origins of the Tomster for an EmberConf talk last year, Jamie White and Tomster illustrator Lindsey Wilson had chuckled about how a mascot needed to be a little bit like the perfect pop song. Distinct, but just generic enough that all different sorts of people could see themselves in it, just like the one right lyric in the song makes it the anthem of a million different emotions and situations.Tomster&#39;s done a great job of that until now, and with the addition of Zoey, even more amazing Ember developers will be able to see themselves in Ember.While Tomster will always be the original friendly face of Em

We frequently receive feedback from new developers about how frustratingit can be to get started with Ember. Yesterday, one of the most activecomment threads on HackerNews was largely about that.We hear you loud and clear. Ember.js is not easy to get started with, and we take that very seriously. We are all working nights and weekends to make the framework as approachable as humanly possible.One of the Hacker News commenters, kanja, nailed it. In response to another commenter who felt like the negative reaction was strong:It&#39;s incredibly out of proportion - but people really want to use ember (because it promises all these great things!) and they&#39;re frustrated by the docs (because they&#39;re not really good for first time users) so this is kind of a flash point.Absolutely right. Ember promises—and, we think, delivers—tremendous value. But ramping up to that point is not easy, and we received this feedback repeatedly and take it very seriously.There was another common sentiment that we&#39;d l

We started with our first core team members pairing together at the creation of Ember, and today it’s one of the foundational parts of our DNA. Now we’re formalizing many of the things we already do, into a more structured, community-wide initiative, so we can do an even better job.Mentorship is a responsibility shared by our entire community, and we’re excited to help it grow. It’s a celebration and elevation of the work that many, many people have contributed to, and a public statement that this is something we care about, prioritize, and intend to keep on doing.Established InitiativesIn addition to some fun new plans, the Ember Mentorship Program umbrella captures and unifies a bunch of existing efforts.

The preview of the Octane edition of Ember is coming soon, and with all these fantastic new features comes a lot of documentation. Since this requires coordination of many moving parts, we want to outline the approach we&#39;re taking, and outlining some ways that the community can contribute.PreparationIn order to prepare for the new edition, the Learning Core Team spent time figuring out how to best transition the existing docs in such a way that was consistent with iterative innovation.One of the goals of improving the guides in general was to improve the learning flow in the guides (see RFC #431). As such, we determined that a change to the table of contents was in order.Updating the guidesAs per the usual standard, we have planned out this work to be able to complete it in an iterative fashion.

Open source project management is different than inside a typical software company. It&#39;s an example of the purest form of leadership: you’re getting a bunch of peers all moving in the same direction, despite no formal hierarchy or authority structure. It comes down to building consensus, persuasion, and setting the right examples.The Ember Core Team was formed in 2011 because even decentralized open source communities need leadership and shared direction. As our community and core contributor group grew, there was too much going on to keep all the work under the direct attention of the Core Team. And so multiple other teams emerged organically; first the Ember CLI team and Ember Data, and later the Learning team.The work that all these teams do is equally important. But the historical accident of Ember Core being the first team left Ember Core with numerous varied jobs. It became the coordination point for both technical leadership and overall community support.As often happens, the wa

This often comes up in an {{#each}} loop where you want to calculate some value using state in the backing class for each item. You could work around this by introducing some other intermediate object via a getter, or by extracting a helper you could call with the state and the item from the loop… but now you can call a method exactly like you would in JS code!Here&#39;s a simplified example with a component which can choose to hide items from a list passed in.Backing class:import C

This access key had permissions for full read/write access to the Ember S3 buckets.These buckets are used to distribute pre-built versions of Ember.js and related libraries and host other static content:Ember.js via builds.emberjs.comEmber Data via builds.emberjs.comBackburner.js via builds.emberjs.comHandlebars.js via builds.handlebarsjs.com.s3.amazonaws.comRSVP.js via rsvpjs-builds.s3.amazonaws.comRouter.js via routerjs.builds.emberjs.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.comEmber guides and API documentationWhile the vast majority of Ember users retrieve new releases from Bower or npm, the builds on S3 are frequently used with online tools like JSBin and Ember Twiddle or anywhere it is more convenient to add a &lt;script&gt; tag.After performing a full audit, we concluded that the key was not accessed during th

Yesterday, we gave you an update on our progress making Ember.js easierto use. One thing we didn&#39;t discuss was our plan for Ember Data.It&#39;s no secret that, while many developers are building awesome appswith Ember.js, Ember Data still causes lots of frustration due to bugsand a changing, complex API. Documentation about it is also mixed inwith Ember.js documentation, making it difficult for new developers tounderstand what is stable and what is not.To be clear, Ember Data is not a dependency of Ember.js.Discourse, for example, usesits own wrapper around$.ajax.Even though Ember Data is not a dependency of Ember.js, loading datafrom the server is an extremely important part of most web applications,and it&#39;s a problem that every Ember.js application will have to dealwith.Our long-term goal is as follows: we don&#39;t think most web developers shouldhave to write any custom XHR code for loading data. Strong conventionson the client and strong conventions on the server should allow them tocommu

The Ember Octane Guides have been updated to show uses of @model.&lt;h2&gt;List of Scientists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt; {{#each @model as |scientist|}} &lt;li&gt;{{scientist}}&lt;/li&gt; {{/each}}&lt;/ul&gt;@model was introduced to help new developers quickly learn templates. By avoiding this.model, they would not need to understand another concept—the controller—to build their first Octane app. By using a named argument, we can also reinforce the idea that @ is used to denote things that are &quot;passed as arguments&quot; to the template.You can try out @model now on canary, or wait for 3.14 ...

Ember Bootstrap brings the Bootstrap library to Ember without requiring any of the Bootstrap JavaScript. Instead, it rebuilds the dynamic features of Bootstrap with native Ember Components.The UI library enters the Octane-era with this new major version: It introduces full support of angle bracket component invocation syntax and an updated documentation. All components have been refactored to native classes.Ember Bootstrap v3 drops support for some very old versions of Ember, but still supports 2.18+ to ease the migration path. The commitment to backwards compatibility introduced some technical challenges because Ember 2.18 isn&#39;t supported by native class polyfill.In add...

The RFC recommends adding a new Identifier API which would contain the name, type, and optionally the namespace fields instead of the current microsyntax.

In the blog, we go through memoization, referential equality, revisions, tags, and how they all work together to provide autotracking for Ember.Memoization, a technique where we cache the previous arguments that a function was called with along with the result they produced in order to minimize excess work, is the foundation of autotracking. However, due to how equality works in JavaScript, we need to make use of referential equality to perform a faster deep-equal wh...

This is done by preprocessing the template via the precompileTemplate API and then establishing that relationship to the JavaScript component using the setComponentTemplate API.These primitives are actually public so anyone can make a transform or parser to build their own custom template import syntax. This flexibility means we can experiment using these primitives before finalizing the API. We can even iterate on it later on to find the best fit for our ecosystem.Watch the full video discussion on YouTube!The &quot;Rock...

The caveat however was that these modifiers were meant for quickly migrating away from classic Ember components to Glimmer components, because they largely allow you to use the same lifecycle hook methods you&#39;ve already written while attaching them to these modifiers.The blog outlines several possibilities to avoid using these modifiers:Creating your own custom modifier when behavior is tied to a particula...

👋 Emberistas! 🐹RFC: Asset Import Spec, ember-element-query v4, EmberFest 2021 - best of both worlds, Glimmer cheatsheet, and Glimmer Apollo v0.4.0.✍️ RFC: Asset Import SpecEdward Faulkner (@ef4) proposed a new RFC which defines the standard semantics for what it means to depend on files that are not JavaScript or CSS, like images, fonts, and other media. The ecosystem today mostly relies on broccoli-asset-rev which is a Broccoli plugin that adds fingerprint checksums and CDN URLs to your assets. The RFC argues that the broccoli-asset-rev plugin does not take advantage of the newer capabilities we have in ember-auto-import and embroider. The proposed pull-based design lets code declare what assets it needs and then not worry about how those assets will get delivered is safer and easier to change in the future.import myImage from &#39;./hello.png&#39;;class extends Component { myImage = myImage}&lt;img src={{this.myImage}} /&gt;If this is something you are interested in, please read and discuss the ...

What&#39;s up Emberistas! 🐹This week you can read about the Component Templates Co-location RFC 🖇️, the story behind ember-model-select 📔, the launch of ember-intl-analyzer 🚀, and EmberFest 2019 announced 🇩🇰!Component Templates Co-location RFC 🖇️@chancancode opened an RFC around placing the component’s class and template in the same directory on the file system. The proposed change is to move the templates from being located at app/templates/components into the app/components directory, co-locating it with the component’s JavaScript file.This change provides component class/template coupling, a single source of truth for components, resolves deviations from route template conventions, and the lack of a single import. If you&#39;d like to learn more, please take a look at RFC #481.

The expected behaviour here is that if you initially set the ariaRole to false it should not be appended, but you might want to dynamically change this later on. This is now fixed with Ember 3.1.1.After upgrading to 3.1 some people started seeing errors like Cannot read property &#39;syscall&#39; of null.

Today the Ember.js Core Team is happy to announce our plans for the release of Ember 3.0. Ember 3.0 will arrive 2.5 years and 18 minor revisions after the release of Ember 2.0. The final release of the 2.x series will be Ember 2.18 on January 1st, 2018.Ember 3.0 removes public API deprecated in Ember 2.x releases. 3.0 does not introduce new public APIs or breaking changes.Traditionally, major releases of software are centered around marketing pitches and new functionality. In contrast, major releases of Ember are “garbage collection” releases. Ember APIs that were deprecated during 2.x but were still supported are purged from the codebase in 3.0. The APIs remaining in 3.0 reflect what we think of as the idiomatic way to build an Ember app.Ember 2.0 was the project’s first attempt at a major release where the transition path for apps and addons was a priority. The community took several important lessons from the 2.0 release cycle, and these have shaped our plans for 3.0. Please take a

Contributors to the Ember project have been hard at work since Ember Octane was released in December 2019.Over the duration of a challenging (and sometimes devastating) year and a half, we&#39;ve shipped a powerful new feature (Named Blocks) and supported an ecosystem shifting to Octane conventions. We&#39;ve more closely aligned Ember with wider frontend conventions through improved publishing &amp; build tooling (Embroider) and better support for TypeScript (both through ember-cli-typescript and reducing reliance on type-unsafe framework features).Check out Godfrey&#39;s EmberConf 2021 keynote fora more complete walk-through of recent changes in Ember.Announcing Ember 4.0In his EmberConf 2021 keynote, Yehuda shared a name for Ember&#39;s next edition: Polaris.

TL;DR Ember Data 1.0 is coming soon. We have a few last features to land before wecan confidently make guarantees around not breaking the API. Specifically:A guarantee that if one side of a two-way relationship changes, the otherside will remain in sync, even if it hasn&#39;t loaded yet.All relationships will become async, but DataBoundPromises will make themwork well in observers, computed properties and in templates.Recall how it took us a few attempts to get the router right, but now we&#39;vegot the best one in JavaScript. Getting Ember Data right has taken longer thanwe thought, but it&#39;s here and it&#39;s almost ready for a 1.0.Ever since the 1.0 release, developers building apps on top of Ember.js haveappreciated the stability and forward-momentum that our commitment to SemanticVersioning allows.We frequently get asked, &quot;Ember.js is great, but what about Ember Data?&quot; Today,we&#39;d like to give you an update on where Ember Data is and where it&#39;s headedsoon.First, the good news: there is only one

There&#39;s been a lot of exciting changes going in the Ember.js community, here&#39;s a recap of some of the biggest updates.Data Format AgnosticismWhile we believe the vast majority of Ember.js apps will be using JSON forcommunication, there&#39;s no reason to restrict it so.To this end we&#39;ve made two changes to Ember Data&#39;s DS.Store:A new extractId method has been added to the adapter for extracting the ID from a data hash, by default this asks for data.id.Any method with the term JSON has been renamed to use Data instead, for instance DS.Serializer&#39;s toJSON method has been renamed to toData.If you are using the built-in DS.RESTAdapter, these changes do not affect you.Check out BREAKING_CHANGESfor more information.Adapter Dirtiness HooksIn line with the efforts to decouple Ember.js from REST specifics, we&#39;ve madesome more changes to how the adapter dirties records in relationships.Previously the store would dirty all the objects involved when a relationship was modifiedand let the adapter decid

There&#39;s a lot of work happening on Ember.js and sometimes it&#39;s hard to keep track of what&#39;s going on. Here&#39;s what me and Yehuda got done this week.MeetupThe SF Ember.js Meetup on Tuesday (which we actually held in MountainView this month) was a success! It was sponsored by our friends atAddepar, who are also funding me and Yehuda to work on Ember Data forthe next few months. So, big thanks to them!Tony Sherbondy gave an overview of the Addepar app and described howEmber.js has helped them. The biggest &quot;a-ha&quot; moment for me was when hedescribed how they completely changed out the table view that powers bigchunks of the UI, and didn&#39;t have to make any changes in the rest of theapp. It&#39;s exactly this type of encapsulation that makes Ember a win, andI&#39;m glad to see it happening in real life.I gave a talk on Ember Data, and discussed some of the new APIs we&#39;ll beworking on over the next few months.

Last Friday, the Ember project merged RFC #0724: Official TypeScript Support, committing to make TypeScript an officially-supported language for Ember.js. To make that a reality, we also need to have a team dedicated to maintaining Ember’s types and its TypeScript compiler integrations.Happily, we already have a group of people who do that! For the last five years, Ember has had community-driven TypeScript support, led by the past and present members of the Typed Ember team.The Typed Ember team joins the Framework, Learning, CLI, and Data Core teams as a new Core sub-team: the Ember TypeScript Core Team. Its initial members are the current Typed Ember team: James Davis (@jamescdavis), Dan Freeman (@dfreeman), and Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho).The team will continue to do all the things they have been doing:maintaining TypeScript build integration with ember-cli-typescript and ember-cli-babelinvesting in type-checked templates via Glintsustaining the community types on DefinitelyTyped (un

Ember&#39;s conventions for project layout and file naming are central to thedeveloper experience. It&#39;s crucial that we get both the technical andergonomic details right. I wanted to provide an update about ModuleUnification and our plans for the file structure in Ember Octane.In short, we do not plan to ship Module Unification in Octane. Instead,Octane will ship with today&#39;s file system layout, with one change: supportfor nested components in &lt;AngleBracket /&gt; invocation syntaxBecause Octane apps will continue with today&#39;s file system layout, we want toaddress the largest barrier to &lt;AngleBracket /&gt; adoption today: componentsnested inside other directories.For example, if you have a component located atapp/components/icons/download-icon.js (i.e., nested inside an iconsdirectory), you can invoke it with curly invocation syntax like this:{{icons/download-icon}}However, it&#39;s not possible to invoke the same nested component with anglebracket syntax without resorting to clunky workarounds.As pr

Updates To The EmberData Lockstep Versioning StrategyToday the EmberData team is excited to announce changes to how we manage lockstepversioning with the broader Ember.js project.The primary goal of these changes is to improve version-to-version stability for our consumers. We see this being beneficial in several ways.First, by releasing fewer versions that contain no effective changes other than the version bump, we believe consumers will be able to navigate version-by-version and LTS-by-LTS upgrades with greater stability and clarity.Second, if the only changes are bug fixes then these fixes are applied to the latest minorinstead of becoming strung out across multiple minors.Third, this should enable the project to move more carefully at times when more substantive changesare being made.We hope that this new policy will improve the ability for us to invest in upgrade paths forconsumers using older versions by focusing on providing the most robust release targets we can.Policy Changes

Every few months, the Ember core team likes to get together to discussissues face-to-face and set our priorities for the following quarter.This time, we all converged on Portland, Oregon for the weekend tofigure out where to focus our energy in 2014.Build Tools &amp; ModulesWe spent the majority of our time discussing a unified plan thatcombines ES6 modules with fast, robust, full-featured build tools forEmber developers.One thing I love about the Ember community is that it values qualityover raw implementation speed. For us, it&#39;s more important to solveproblems than to solvescenarios,because scenario solving leads to fragmented solutions that don&#39;t scaleor compose as your app grows.So far, we&#39;ve held off on endorsing any particular build tool because,while we&#39;ve investigated all of them thoroughly, the currently-availableoptions all have fatal flaws that make them unpleasant to use as yourapp gets larger.Many people have also been asking us about modules. When we startedEmber, there were
