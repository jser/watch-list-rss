Posted by Alex Rebert, Security Foundations, and Chandler Carruth, Jen Engel, Andy Qin, Core DevelopersError-prone interactions between software and memory1 are widely understood to create safety issues in software. It is estimated that about 70% of severe vulnerabilities2 in memory-unsafe codebases are due to memory safety bugs. Malicious actors exploit these vulnerabilities and continue to create real-world harm. In 2023, Google’s threat intelligence teams conducted an industry-wide study and observed a close to all-time high number of vulnerabilities exploited in the wild. Our internal analysis estimates that 75% of CVEs used in zero-day exploits are memory safety vulnerabilities.At Google, we have been mindful of these issues for over two decades, and are on a journey to continue advancing the state of memory safety in the software we consume and produce.

Are those bugs security bugs? Specifically, if a user’s clicks and actions result in memory corruption, is that something that an attacker can exploit to harm that user?Our security severity guidelines say “yes, sometimes.” For example, an attacker could very likely convince a user to click an autofill prompt, but it will be much harder to convince the user to step through a whole flow of different dialogs.Even if these bugs aren’t the most easily exploitable, it takes a great deal of time for our security shepherds to make these determinations.

In this blog, we&#39;ll take a peek under the hood to see how Pixel mitigates common exploits on cellular basebands.Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives, but few of us think about the complex software that powers them, especially the cellular baseband – the processor on the device responsible for handling all cellular communication (such as LTE, 4G, and 5G). Most smartphones use cellular baseband processors with tight performance constraints, making security hardening difficult. Security researchers have increasingly exploited this attack vector and routinely demonstrated the possibility of exploiting basebands used in popular smartphones.The good news is that Pixel has been deploying security hardening mitigations in our basebands for years, and Pixel 9 represents the most hardened baseband we

Posted by Alex Gough, Chrome Security TeamThe Chrome Security Team is constantly striving to make it safer to browse the web. We invest in mechanisms to make classes of security bugs impossible, mitigations that make it more difficult to exploit a security bug, and sandboxing to reduce the capability exposed by an isolated security issue. When choosing where to invest it is helpful to consider how bad actors find and exploit vulnerabilities. In this post we discuss several axes along which to evaluate the potential harm to users from exploits, and how they apply to the Chrome browser.Historically the Chrome Security Team has made major investments and driven the web to be safer. We pioneered browser sandboxing, site isolation and the migration to an encrypted web. Today we’re investing in Rust for memory safety, hardening our existing C++ code-base, and improving detection with GWP-asan and lightweight use-after-free (UAF) detection.

Posted by Jeff Vander Stoep - Android team, and Alex Rebert - Security FoundationsMemory safety vulnerabilities remain a pervasive threat to software security. At Google, we believe the path to eliminating this class of vulnerabilities at scale and building high-assurance software lies in Safe Coding, a secure-by-design approach that prioritizes transitioning to memory-safe languages.This post demonstrates why focusing on Safe Coding for new code quickly and counterintuitively reduces the overall security risk of a codebase, finally breaking through the stubbornly high plateau of memory safety vulnerabilities and starting an exponential decline, all while being scalable and cost-effective.We’ll also share updated data on how the percentage of memory safety vulnerabilities in Android dropped from 76% to 24% over 6 years as development shifted to memory safe languages.Counterintuitive results1 as new memory unsafe development slows down, and new memory safe development starts to take ove

Most exploitable GPU vulnerabilities are in the implementation of the GPU kernel mode modules. These modules are pieces of code that load/unload during runtime, extending functionality without the need to reboot the device.Proactive testing is good hygiene as it can lead to the detection and resolution of new vulnerabilities before they’re exploited. It’s also one of the most complex investigations to do as you don’t necessarily know where the vulnerability will appear (that’s the point!). By combining the expertise of Google’s engineers with IP owners and OEMs, we can ensure the Android ecosystem retains a strong measure of integrity.

Posted by David Adrian, David Benjamin, Bob Beck &amp; Devon O&#39;Brien, Chrome TeamWe previously posted about experimenting with a hybrid post-quantum key exchange, and enabling it for 100% of Chrome Desktop clients. The hybrid key exchange used both the pre-quantum X25519 algorithm, and the new post-quantum algorithm Kyber. At the time, the NIST standardization process for Kyber had not yet finished.Since then, the Kyber algorithm has been standardized with minor technical changes and renamed to the Module Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM). We have implemented ML-KEM in Google’s cryptography library, BoringSSL, which allows for it to be deployed and utilized by services that depend on this library.The changes to the final version of ML-KEM make it incompatible with the previously deployed version of Kyber. As a result, the codepoint in TLS for hybrid post-quantum key exchange is changing from 0x6399 for Kyber768+X25519, to 0x11EC for ML-KEM768+X25519. To handle this, we will be m

Posted by Ivan Lozano and Dominik Maier, Android Team Android&#39;s use of safe-by-design principles drives our adoption of memory-safe languages like Rust, making exploitation of the OS increasingly difficult with every release. To provide a secure foundation, we’re extending hardening and the use of memory-safe languages to low-level firmware (including in Trusty apps).In this blog post, we&#39;ll show you how to gradually introduce Rust into your existing firmware, prioritizing new code and the most security-critical code. You&#39;ll see how easy it is to boost security with drop-in Rust replacements, and we&#39;ll even demonstrate how the Rust toolchain can handle specialized bare-metal targets.Drop-in Rust replacements for C code are not a novel idea and have been used in other cases, such as librsvg’s adoption of Rust which involved replacing C functions with Rust functions in-place.

Posted by Nataliya Stanetsky and Roger Piqueras Jover, Android Security &amp; Privacy TeamCell-site simulators, also known as False Base Stations (FBS) or Stingrays, are radio devices that mimic real cell sites in order to lure mobile devices to connect to them. These devices are commonly used for security and privacy attacks, such as surveillance and interception of communications. In recent years, carriers have started reporting new types of abuse perpetrated with FBSs for the purposes of financial fraud.In particular, there is increasingly more evidence of the exploitation of weaknesses in cellular communication standards leveraging cell-site simulators to inject SMS phishing messages directly into smartphones. This method to inject messages entirely bypasses the carrier network, thus bypassing all the sophisticated network-based anti-spam and anti-fraud filters.

Today, we’re announcing another layer of protection to make Windows users safer from this type of malware.Like other software that needs to store secrets, Chrome currently secures sensitive data like cookies and passwords using the strongest techniques the OS makes available to us - on macOS this is the Keychain services, and on Linux we use a system provided wallet such as kwallet or gnome-libsecret. On Windows, Chrome uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI) which protects the data at rest from other users on the system or cold boot attacks.

Matt Linton, Chaos SpecialistIn the late 19th and early 20th century, a series of catastrophic fires in short succession led an outraged public to demand action from the budding fire protection industry. Among the experts, one initial focus was on “Fire Evacuation Tests”. The earliest of these tests focused on individual performance and tested occupants on their evacuation speed, sometimes performing the tests “by surprise” as though the fire drill were a real fire. These early tests were more likely to result in injuries to the test-takers than any improvement in survivability. It wasn’t until introducing better protective engineering - wider doors, push bars at exits, firebreaks in construction, lighted exit signs, and so on - that survival rates from building fires began to improve. As protections evolved over the years and improvements like mandatory fire sprinklers became required in building code, survival rates have continued to improve steadily, and “tests” have evolved into an

Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers – for Bluetooth tracking devices that makes it possible to alert users across both Android and iOS if such a device is unknowingly being used to track them. This will help mitigate the misuse of devices designed to help keep track of belongings. Google is now launching this capability on Android 6.0+ devices, and today Apple is implementing this capability in iOS 17.5.Multi-layered user protections, including first of its kind safety-first protections, help mitigate potential risks to user privacy and safety while allowing users to effectively locate and recover lost devices. This cross-platform collaboration — an industry first, involving community and industry input — offers instructions and best practices for manufacturers, should they choose to build unwanted tracking alert capabilities into their products.

Sriram Karra and Christiaan Brand, Google product managersLast year, Google launched passkey support for Google Accounts. Passkeys are a new industry standard that give users an easy, highly secure way to sign-in to apps and websites. Today, we announced that passkeys have been used to authenticate users more than 1 billion times across over 400 million Google Accounts.As more users encounter passkeys, we’re often asked questions about how they relate to security keys, how Google Workspace administrators can configure passkeys for the user accounts that they manage, and how they relate to the Advanced Protection Program (APP). This post will seek to clarify these topics.Passkeys and security keysPasskeys are an evolution of security keys, meaning users get the same security benefits, but with a much simplified experience. Passkeys can be used in the Google Account sign-in process in many of the same ways that security keys have been used in the past — in fact, you can now choose to sto
