The topic of using enums in TypeScript has been discussed a lot, but many developers still remain unaware of their drawbacks. Even though enums are popular and commonly used, they might not always be the best choice. In this article, I&#39;ll share my thoughts on why enums can be a problem and show you a better way to do things.TL;DR#enum is a TypeScript-only feature and doesn&#39;t exist in JavaScript.enum has several problems:The compiled output can be hard to read and understand, leading to potential bugs.Performance impacts due to runtime creation and initialization.Compatibility issues with type declarations, especially in projects using isolatedModules.Use as const with a generic type helper: export type TypeFrom&lt;T&gt; = T[keyof T] for a simpler, more efficient alternative.If you are a TypeScript developer, you’re likely familiar with using enums. However, have you ever considered what enums in TypeScript actually represent? It&#39;s worth noting that JavaScript doesn&#39;t have the enum feature.It

Hi there!Deno, created by Ryan Dahl, the original mind behind Node.js, is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It addresses various limitations and issues found in Node.js.Since its initial stable release with version 1.0, Deno has continued to evolve, with the latest version currently at 1.44. Are you ever curious about Deno&#39;s suitability for production projects today? Wondering if developers are actively using it in production?You can read my full article for a detailed analysis here: Should You Switch to Deno?.I hope this helps you make an informed decision. Happy coding!Note: Why didn’t I write this article on my personal blog?

Hi there!Today, ECMAScript Modules (ESM) have become the standard for writing JavaScript on both the front end and back end. However, many projects still use CommonJS (CJS), particularly those that have been around for a while.If your project is written in TypeScript, you&#39;re in luck. TypeScript already uses ESM syntax with import and export. However, one thing to keep in mind is that if your TypeScript project does not specify &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;, it will still output CommonJS.With Deno, JSR, or Bun, the question of using CJS or ESM doesn&#39;t really matter. Deno and JSR enforce the use of ESM exclusively, while Bun supports both CommonJS and ESM. However, in Node.js, this question still requires careful consideration.When building a library for npm, it&#39;s advisable to support both ESM and CommonJS (dual package). This is the approach taken by most popular packages today, as it allows any type of project to use the library. But how can we achieve this? It can be complex and challenging to mai

Guess what? My blog now offers full-text RSS feeds!Not long ago, I discovered a new way to get updates RSS feeds from websites using a reader app. It might seem strange, right? Most people probably already know about this method since it has existed for a long time, but I had no idea about it before. I only knew how to subscribe to newsletters via email.For the past two years, I&#39;ve been reading a lot more, especially on daily.dev, a platform where people share interesting articles. I&#39;ve found many new blogs that I want to follow and subscribe to. I don’t remember exactly where I learned about subscribing to RSS feeds, but it was probably from a &quot;subscribe&quot; or &quot;newsletter&quot; tab on a blog, maybe tonsky.me. They explained how to use a reader app to subscribe to RSS feeds. It&#39;s totally free and really cool! So, I started using that method to subscribe to other blogs. It&#39;s much easier than using email. My blog also supports RSS feeds via atom.xml.However, there&#39;s one important thing to menti

Hi everyone 👋,Recently, I attended Ekinoday, our company’s annual conference, where my colleagues share knowledge on various topics, from technology to life tips. This event is always very interesting for me.I had a chance to talk with my colleague Raphaël Tho Vo, who gave a presentation on optimising web performance. Raphaël mentioned that many people don’t realise how much image size and format can effect the web performance. Large image files can slow down a website significantly, affecting user experience.Raphaël explained that we can improve performance by using better image formats. He mentioned several modern formats like AVIF, WebP, JPEG 2000. Among these, AVIF and WebP are the most supported by web browsers today.Inspired by Raphaël’s advice, I decided to take a closer look at my website&#39;s performance. I host my site on GitHub, using Zola, a static site engine, along with the Tabi theme. This theme is beautifully designed and well-coded.I tested my website with PageSpeed Insi...

In a recent article, I discussed transforming a GitHub profile into an interactive space with icons, badges, and dynamically updated blog posts using Python scripts and GitHub actions.After sharing my work in the &quot;r/javascript&quot; community on Reddit, I received serveral positive feedback and upvotes. I chose to post in this community due to my familiarity with JavaScript and TypeScript. After several hours, moderators removed my post because it wasn&#39;t directly related to JavaScript. They made the right decision, and I appreciate their careful moderation of the community. This made me rethink my approach and think about using a language that would better connect with the audience, given the simplicity of the script&#39;s principle: fetching feed URL, parsing it, and writing the response to the README.md file, along with automatic updates using a cron job on GitHub action.I decided to explore using JavaScript or TypeScript for this idea. While JavaScript would have been sufficient, I opted for

Hey there, it&#39;s been quite a while since my last article—almost 3 years. I&#39;m not sure if anyone is still reading my posts because I&#39;ve stopped using analytics for my website. Now, I&#39;ve moved it to GitHub and use the free domain of GitHub Pages. It might not be great for SEO, but I&#39;m happy with it. After all, the main reason I write is for myself. Each time I write, I learn something new and improve my skills on various topics.So, I&#39;ve decided to get back into the habit of writing regularly. It&#39;s a good practice for developers to improve day by day.But first things first: I need to update my website. In the past, I usually used Jekyll to create my site. It runs on Ruby and used to fit my needs perfectly because it&#39;s free, powerful, and offers many themes for customization.For my main website where I display my work, projects, and some information about me, I used Jekyll but did a lot of customization using SCSS. And for the blog, I used a customized theme named &quot;Ghost.&quot; It looks really

Hey everyone! I&#39;m excited to share my journey from being a BIM engineer to becoming a full-time developer.In modern construction, digital technologies are being used more and more. A big development is Building Information Modeling (BIM), which involves putting a lot of information about things like materials, planning, costs and more into 3D models.As a BIM engineer, my main job was to make sure this process worked well, fast, and effectively for different construction teams, like architects, engineers, and planners. My aim was to keep high-quality models that each team could use again, reducing the need to do things over. We mainly used a software named Revit for this.To do high-quality work, I used my skills in programming to make processes automatic. So, I spent time writing scripts and plugins in languages like VBA, C#, and Python to make things easier for my company.Balancing two different roles at the same time was complicated. Since learning programming is a big challenge, it m

What is Docker compose?#If you read this article, I think you maybe already understand what is Docker.Docker is a tool which helps to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Docker provides developers and operators with a friendly interface to build, ship, and run containers on any environment.With the docker-cli, we can run and execute the Docker container via Dockerfile. But with Dockerfile, we can work only with a container, but in the project, we normally work with multiple containers. In that case, we need to use Docker compose.Docker Compose define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment. It get an app running in one command by just running docker-compose up.Docker compose uses the Dockerfile if one add the build command to your project’s docker-compose.yml. Your Docker workflow should be to build a suitable Dockerfile for each image you wish to create, then use compose to assemble the image

Programming in a new language can feel unfamiliar, intimidating, and tricky to navigate at first. There are new rules, syntax, and nuances to learn.Python vs. JavaScript Language Basics#JavaScript and Python are interpreted programming languages, meaning their runtime environments use an interpreter (or engine) that parses and executes code one statement at a time.The two languages are also “object-based” — everything is (or can be treated as) an object: strings, numbers, data structures, functions, etc.Primitive Types#First up, JavaScript and Python have similar built-in data types. For example, both use numeric data types (integers and floats), strings and Booleans.// JavaScript data typesconst pi = 3.14;const age = 31;const greeting = &quot;good morning&quot;;const isAdmin = true;# Python data typespi = 3.14age = 13greeting = &quot;good morning&quot;is_admin = TrueType Checking and Conversion#Python and JavaScript are “dynamically typed” languages, which means you do not have to set the type of a varia

What version of rails you use in your projects, today?At THP, when we start learning rails, we are required to install rails version 5.2.3. But I when I see that the new version of rails has been released is already 6.0. So we have posed a question for our technical manager of THP:Why we don&#39;t install directly the version rails 6.0?And he said: &quot;One word: webpack. I always don&#39;t understand so much for the &quot;webpack&quot;, and I need to search more on the internet. And with this article (this is not mine), we will know some advantages and new features of rails 6 .I hear that: Rails 5 is still just fineRails 5.0.Z is still on the severe patches list, and Rails 5.2.Z is still receiving regular security updates; so you&#39;re still OK on Rails 5 (especially 5.2 or higher)Now We will see 4 amazing features of rails 6.Parralled Testing#Test’s performance is finally going to be improved (a lot!).

When you need to use multiple versions of Rails on your computer, how do you switch between them?Installation rails#Before I talk about how to switch a version of rails, I will go quickly how to install the different versions of rails. The ruby package manager that I&#39;am using is rbenv and I will use it for this tuto.If you are using another ruby package manager like rvm, you should look at rbenv and its advantage. rbenv is more lighter and faster than the rvm and rbenv is very recommended by a a lot of developers.There is an article on dev.to help you understand more clearly: Why and How I Replaced RVM with RBENV.Ok, now go on our article.To install whatever version(s) of rails you want:gem install rails -v 6.0.3.2To know all rails versions released, you check out on all rails versions.You can also do it with your terminal with the command line gem list rails --remote --all | grep &quot;^rails &quot;.I you want to install rails on another version of ruby, you need to switch version of ruby and r

In this article, we&#39;ll walk through how to set up a Jekyll-powered blog using the Minimal Mistakes theme.It’s not always clear why we need a personal website, but here’s the truth, especially for developers: a website is an effective medium to let the world know who we are, what we are capable of, and what our values are.The purpose of the website you want to build can vary; it could be a blog, portfolio, landing page, or multi-purpose site. In my case, I need a website to:Showcase my projectsBlog about my experiences, my knowledge in programming, and my other interestsShare information about me that would be of interest to a recruiter, including my resume, email, and links to my GitHub, Medium, and LinkedIn pagesBeing able to easily generate and publish blog posts is another extremely beneficial feature, though not required.Initially, I tried to create my website using HTML, CSS, and serving it with GitHub Pages.
