It’s easy to see how SaaS sprawl happens if you picture the moment it starts. A team is blocked, someone needs a tool ASAP, and the answer to their problems lies just behind a free trial, so they sign up for a new tool. No one is being careless. They’re being efficient. The problem is that follow-up rarely keeps pace with new sign-ups, especially when the card on file belongs to &quot;the company&quot; and the requester has already moved on to the next priority.Months later, you realize you are paying for services you don’t use and can’t remember how to log in to, let alone cancel. Every invitation to “try this new tool” adds another subscription, another license, and another place where company IP is stored. Over time, this SaaS sprawl creates an environment overrun with shadow IT and unmanaged apps that IT, security, and finance teams can’t fully see or control.To get ahead of this, IT teams turn to SaaS management, a process for discovering in-use apps, managing access, and optimizing softwar

Why SaaS license waste is a cost and security problem</a><div class="ui-feed-item__blog-title">Blog on 1Password Blog</div><div class="ui-feed-item__summary">
Unused SaaS licenses are a budget drain and a security risk. The need to easily track and manage SaaS licenses and identify unused ones is a challenge that every modern organization faces. The problem is that most IT teams can’t confidently answer a basic question: Are we using the licenses that we’re paying for? Why? Answering this simple question is more complicated than it seems.Why tracking license usage mattersEvery inactive user account or orphaned license is wasted budget and a potential door for bad actors into your environment. Without visibility into license usage, you’re likely:Paying for licenses that no one’s usingWasting time during renewals or facing true-ups because you can’t validate user countsExposing your business to risk with accounts tied to former employeesTracking SaaS licenses is difficult because it stems from a range of other issues. These issues often persist in organizations, despite best intentions to simplify and streamline deprovisioning: Apps are decent

Every 1Password account tells a story.For many of our customers, 1Password is one of the first purchases they make after starting a company. Founders store their company’s social media credentials before they’ve written their first post, their cloud provider’s root credentials before they’ve spun up their first server, the shared mobile developer account before they publish their first app, and even the access code for the door at the entrance of their office, before they’ve added furniture.As companies grow, so does the number of apps their teams rely on, and access spreads beyond what IT can easily see or control. This shift toward business-led IT breaks traditional perimeter and identity assumptions. Shared credentials become the default for anything that doesn’t live behind SSO, and critical accounts end up scattered across vaults, spreadsheets, and browsers. When someone changes roles or leaves, those credentials can quietly live on; in fact, 38% of employees admit to accessing a

AI-assisted development crossed the “cool demo” threshold long ago. It is now a daily workflow. Generate code. Refactor. Run tests. Spin up infrastructure. Deploy.The speed is real. And so is the expanded security surface area that comes with it. The challenge is no longer whether teams should adopt AI-assisted development, but how to do so without putting credentials and access at risk.At 1Password, we believe the answer starts with treating secure access as an integral part of the development workflow. AI can accelerate the work, but access to real systems, credentials, and secrets must remain deliberate, time-bound, and under human control.A recent piece of research titled IDEsaster highlights why this moment matters. It introduces a new vulnerability class that emerges when AI agents are embedded into IDEs that were not originally designed for autonomous or semi-autonomous action. The key insight is not that any single tool is flawed. It is that adding agentic capabilities to famil

Developers are moving faster than ever with AI. Cursor is redefining how software gets built, and 1Password is redefining how teams secure access to SaaS and AI. Today, we are announcing a new integration that brings these two worlds together in a way that keeps development speed high and credential risk near zero.1Password has partnered with Cursor to build a Hooks Script that gives developers a secure, just-in-time way to ensure required secrets are made available to Cursor’s AI agents via 1Password Environments. The result is an AI-native development workflow where secrets are never hardcoded, raw credentials are never handled directly by AI agents, and secure access becomes a natural part of writing and running code.This functionality is available today as a first step and lays the foundation for a broader set of secure developer workflows we intend to build together.Why this mattersDevelopers should never have to paste tokens into config files or store long-lived credentials on di

Twenty-seven episodes. Dozens of CISOs and security leaders. Hours of honest conversation about what actually keeps them up at night.When I launched the show, the goal was simple. Strip out the fluff and talk about how security really works inside organizations that ship software, handle sensitive data, and carry real operational risk—just practitioners comparing scars.This season covered three big threads that kept looping back into each other. The changing reality of the CISO role. The rise of agentic AI systems. The grind of day-to-day security work in complex environments. All of it shaped by people who actually own the outcomes.The CISO job is no longer “just security”Across episodes with sitting CISOs, former CISOs, and advisors, one theme kept repeating. The role has outgrown the narrow idea of “head of security.”Guests talked about shaping product strategy, influencing M&amp;A decisions, and acting as a translator between engineering, legal, and the board.

Anthropic recently announced that the company has disrupted the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign. This attack used Claude Code to automate many steps, with AI handling up to 90% of the tasks, including web searches and the autonomous writing of exploit code. The attackers bypassed Claude’s guardrails by breaking each step into small tasks and role-playing as a red team member. By taking this approach, the attackers avoided having any individual Al task flagged for violating Claude guardrails. While this type of attack is new, the bad actors also relied on tried-and-true methods to maximize access. Once the AI agents obtained valid certificates, they relied on password extraction to move laterally within the target systems. Anthropic has broken down the espionage campaign into six distinct phases:Campaign initialization and target selection: Human operators chose the relevant targets to be infiltrated.Reconnaissance and attack surface mapping: AI cataloged target

There’s a good chance something important is missing from your IT team’s offboarding checklist, and it may be causing a steady drip of unnecessary, wasted spend. The source of this leak? No, it’s not the unreturned laptops; it’s the licenses for SaaS apps that employees use every day. The SaaS landscape is littered with apps outside IT’s direct control, and when there’s employee turnover, it’s often difficult to ensure that every license across every app is accounted for. One symptom of this problem is that former employees often retain access to apps long after they should have been revoked. In fact, 1Password’s research found that 38% of employees have accessed a prior employer’s accounts after leaving the company. That’s not so much a leaky faucet as a burst pipe.The problem here is that the average IT stack wasn’t built for comprehensive offboarding. The majority of IT teams handle offboarding through a combination of automation and manual processes, but this piecemeal approach is

This year has been one of the most transformative in our collaboration with AWS. As organizations move faster toward AI-driven development and cloud-native architectures, secure access has become a foundational requirement, not an afterthought. In just a few years, we’ve gone from experimenting with GPTs to deploying action-oriented AI agents that read, write, execute, and automate workflows across production systems. These developments unlock new levels of productivity, but they also introduce new access and security challenges.That’s why AWS and 1Password have deepened their collaboration to help customers adopt AI tools safely and still capture the benefits it offers. Together, we’re making it easier for developers to authenticate, build, and operate agents securely, and using AI to streamline the login experience itself.What began as a collaboration has evolved into real momentum and a shared vision for the future of secure identity and automation in cloud-native environments.

Security leaders are under pressure to manage an expanding number of SaaS apps and shadow IT. Automation transforms the fight for visibility into a framework of continuous monitoring.Virtually every company runs on more SaaS than it can see, and spends more on it than it can control.From analytics tools to HR platforms and AI agents, every new license improved productivity while expanding the surface that IT and security must protect.For years, Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) systems formed the backbone of enterprise security, authenticating users, enforcing policies, and governing access.

In Episode 4 of Securing the Win, Oracle Red Bull Racing CIO Matt Cadieux joins host Calum Nicholas at MK7 in Milton Keynes to answer a crucial question: how do you make the secure path the fastest path?For Cadieux’s team, speed is nothing without trust. Behind every lap, every call, and every win lies a digital backbone built to guard against the unseen. As threats in Formula 1® mature and proliferate, a single weak sign-in or device can compromise safety and performance. Cadieux safeguards racing, manufacturing, and logistics. His answer is simple and hard-won: design for failure, verify trust continuously, and partner where it buys speed, so when pressure spikes, the car keeps flying.Revving cyber resilienceCadieux’s resilience playbook supports Oracle Red Bull Racing’s culture of innovation, where resilience isn’t just a project, but a practice.

When IT and security teams lack visibility and control over the SaaS apps employees use, the result is wasted spend, unsanctioned access, and compliance failures. Yet 1Password’s research shows that all too often, SaaS usage is evading the tools meant to govern it.This blog is part two in our series analyzing the 1Password Annual Report 2025: The Access-Trust Gap.

Summary and key findings1Password surveyed 2,000 American adults to learn how people are protecting themselves from phishing scams this holiday season (“phishing” refers to all those scammy emails, shady texts, and fake ads, where hackers try to trick people into clicking a link that lets them steal money or information). What we learned is that holiday scams are getting bolder and harder to spot, thanks to the help of AI. Here are some of the other most eye-opening findings:AI is the new gift wrap for holiday scams:66% of Americans say they’ve noticed more scammy messages, phone calls, and ads since AI became more prevalent. Taking the bait: 82% of respondents have been phished, or come dangerously close to it. Younger generations are falling first: Gen Z (70%) and Millennials (67%) are more likely to be phished compared to Gen X (57%) and Boomers (46%).Duplicate passwords are a gift to hackers: A whopping 76% of Americans who&#39;ve fallen victim to a shopping scam still reuse passwords

Unsanctioned AI tools. Patchy access controls. Unmanaged apps and devices. And of course, compromised credentials. These are the issues revealed in the 1Password Annual Report 2025: The Access-Trust Gap.The report is based on a survey of over 5,000 knowledge workers, IT and security professionals, and CISOs, and it captures a moment of profound technological and cultural transition. Companies are still playing catch-up to the last few years of change: the rise of hybrid work, the SaaS explosion, the blurred lines between work and personal devices, and AI. IT and security teams are discovering that their go-to tools for securing identities and managing access, such as SSO and MDM, weren’t designed for this world.The result is a widening Access-Trust Gap: the divide between the types of access that security and IT teams can control, and the reality of how people (and now AI agents) access sensitive data in practice.The survey data reveals four areas where the Access-Trust Gap is widest a

Agentic AI is a fundamentally new paradigm. AI agents can interact with various tools and act dynamically and probabilistically as they encounter new inputs. That means they end up falling somewhere between an application and a user in terms of how they operate. Indeed, the interaction with other applications is what gives agentic AI its power; however, this also has implications for identity security and access management.Given this new paradigm, we’ve found it helpful to develop a simple taxonomy for agentic AI that guides the specific security measures that must be considered for each agent. We break this down into three distinct categories:What type of AI agent is it, and how does it interact with the world?Where is the agent running?Who is the agent running on behalf of?Note: At 1Password, we have a set of AI security principles that apply across this entire taxonomy, regardless of how an agent is classified.

The new .env destination in 1Password environments makes it easy for developers to use and collaborate on .env files securely, right from the desktop app.1Password environments provide a secure workspace to store, organize, and manage project secrets – the same credentials you would normally handle as environment variables.

We launched this functionality in beta earlier this month, and have already had some rave reviews:“Just wanted to drop some feedback after playing around with the new Environments Beta in 1Password.

In the premiere episode of Securing the Win, 1Password’s docuseries with Oracle Red Bull Racing, viewers get an exclusive look inside the mindset of Laurent Mekies, the new CEO and Team Principal.After leading the Racing Bulls in 2024 into the 2025 mid-season, Mekies steps into one of the most demanding roles in motorsport – leading a championship team where performance is measured in thousandths of a second. His mission: steward a championship legacy, navigate pressures to stay ahead, and balance the responsibilities of leading a team operating at the edge of human and technological performance.And yet, for all the data and downforce analysis, Mekies insists success begins with people. “Formula 1® is a people business,” he says. “Everything you see around here – the infrastructure, the tools, the processes – they’re just a consequence of the quality of the people we have.”Mekies’ is the story of trust at 300 km/h and learning to steer legacy, innovation, and human potential toward a s

AI agents increasingly are completing real tasks in the browser, acting on behalf of employees, and connecting to the same systems humans rely on to get work done. This introduces a new security problem: AI agents require credentials – passwords, API keys, and one-time codes – to operate. As agents proliferate, the risk surface increases and it brings a variety of identity and access management challenges:No single source of truth for secrets management across agentic AI and employeesDifficulty of revoking credentials/items, especially long-lived onesProliferation of untracked/out-of-date credential grantsAgentic browsers, such as headless agentic browsers or those being driven by AI models without direct human supervision, raise the stakes even higher. As AI agents execute workflows, they get paused while agentic browsers wait for humans to input credentials. In an effort to avoid agents stopping mid-workflow, users often provide credentials directly into a browser-use AI app, which i

Your password manager might be closing up shop, putting your digital security at risk. In recent months, two major tech players – Dropbox and Microsoft – have discontinued their built-in password manager features. If you’ve been relying on Microsoft Authenticator or Dropbox Password, it’s now time to decide how you’ll protect your accounts going forward.When companies discontinue their password managers, it’s more than an inconvenience. It leaves customers, both consumers and businesses, at higher risk of credential theft. Without a password manager, users are more likely to fall back on bad habits, such as reusing passwords across multiple accounts. That means that one successful phishing attack could be all it takes for criminals to have access to everything.“When password management is a side feature, it’s a future sunset. Choose a provider whose core business is protecting identities so your defences don’t change when someone else’s roadmap does,” said Dave Lewis, 1Password global

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we discover, reason, and interact online. New browsers like Comet, the AI-powered web browser by Perplexity, are a tangible example of this. As AI becomes more embedded in how we browse the web, one truth remains: credentials remain foundational to everything we do online, and they must be secured.That’s why we’re excited to announce that the 1Password browser extension is now available in Comet. With 1Password, credentials and sensitive data, like credit card information, used in Comet are protected by the same end-to-end encryption and zero-knowledge architecture trusted by millions of people and over 165,000 businesses.Why security matters on the AI-powered internetThink about how much of your life you unlock with credentials, including your email, bank account, favorite shopping sites, social media, and more.

For decades, sales has carried a particular image: fast-talking men in suits, closing deals in boardrooms. It’s been a career that has, at least in people’s imaginations, been dominated by men. But the reality is changing. More women are stepping into sales roles and proving that success here doesn’t belong to one gender.I’ve had a front-row seat to this transformation. I started my career in sales enablement, where I watched women sellers hit their stride, break records, and step into leadership roles – all while challenging outdated perceptions of what success in sales should look like.However, early in my sales enablement career, I had a tough realization: I’d never actually carried a quota. Yet here I was, creating programs and resources I expected sales reps to use in the field. It made me feel like a fraud.So I did something bold – I became a sales rep for a quarter. I joined standups, worked real deals, and even closed revenue. It was uncomfortable, and honestly, I was terrified

For security teams, the stakes are rarely as high as they are during mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). Suddenly, you’re tasked with managing two companies&#39; worth of devices, applications, identities, and data. There can be serious issues lurking within the newly acquired (or soon-to-be-acquired) company, including legacy systems, poorly vetted third-party contractors, and incompatible security policies.Examples of what can go wrong during an M&amp;A are legion, but the mergers of Verizon and Yahoo, as well as Marriott and Starwood, stand out as two particularly public fiascos. During both mergers, it was discovered that security oversights led to massive data breaches, costing hundreds of millions of dollars and creating a PR nightmare for all involved.Due diligenceStories of M&amp;As gone wrong demonstrate the importance of the due diligence phase. For security leaders, the most critical window in an M&amp;A is before the ink dries. To mitigate any unpleasant post-acquisition surprises, security sh

This blog details how 1Password has addressed clickjacking in the latest version of our browser extension (version 8.11.7). We have no indication that this class of vulnerability directly puts 1Password&#39;s systems at risk.Clickjacking is a technique where a malicious or compromised webpage visually disguises or overlays elements of a page or browser extension, like the autofill menu, so that a user unintentionally clicks on them. In practice, this could allow a site to trick users into autofilling card details, identity items, or other information without realizing it.Clickjacking isn’t new, and it’s not unique to password managers. It’s a long-standing web technique that affects many websites and browser extensions. At its core, it’s a browser-level limitation, not something a single browser extension can fully solve.How 1Password is responding to clickjackingWe take every security concern seriously. While clickjacking can only be fully resolved at the browser level, we’ve introduced a

There are two enormous cybersecurity events each year in the United States: RSA Conference and the week in Vegas that is so full of conferences, summits, and ancillary events that it&#39;s simply known as &quot;Hacker Summer Camp.&quot; From Security BSides Las Vegas to Black Hat and DEF CON, it takes the fortitude of a camel to survive the desert heat and the late nights. I&#39;ve been going to summer camp for at least fifteen years in different contexts: as a CISO, an industry analyst, a threat intelligence research director, and as a security vendor team member. All of these contexts are different, and they shape the way I look at the goings-on.For several years, I was involved with the Black Hat CISO Summit as a member of the advisory board.

AI is transforming the way we work. There are immense opportunities for automation, intelligent decision-making, and productivity gains. This transformation is a tremendous opportunity, but it also comes with tremendous responsibility, especially when security is involved. For example, AI systems can now act on behalf of users, access sensitive data across tools, and make decisions without oversight, all of which have security implications.Building AI you can trustOne broader principle we embrace at 1Password is the “principle of yes.” It’s the idea that security must enable individuals and employees to do their jobs. This underlying principle is also true of AI agents. Our goal is to enable AI agents to do what they’re designed to, but in a way that is trustworthy, secure, and follows best practices.At 1Password, we strive to make security effortless and universal.

It’s difficult for organizations to stay secure, compliant, and efficient in an ever-expanding SaaS landscape. Every time an employee joins or leaves the company, or a software vendor is added or removed, IT and security teams must grant and revoke permissions, so the right people have access to the right tools. A mistake in this process could allow an offboarded employee to maintain access to sensitive data years after they left the company, so the stakes are high.To manage this process, companies must develop a SaaS governance strategy: A security framework to manage, secure, and optimize the use of SaaS tools across departments. It defines the policies, roles, and controls that determine how users access sensitive data and resources.A critical part of a SaaS governance strategy is access reviews. Access reviews are the operational backbone of SaaS governance: Regular, structured evaluations that validate whether users still need the access they’ve been granted. Access reviews are al

Omdia, a global analyst and advisory leader, recently released a report called “How Extended Access Management (XAM) closes the gaps in security.” In it, they describe how existing tools have failed to address the most serious security challenges: application sprawl, device sprawl, and identity sprawl.Each of these challenge areas has become riskier and more pervasive in recent years; app sprawl has grown with the proliferation of easily accessible SaaS, and device sprawl has increased with unsanctioned BYOD usage. But no challenge area has been transformed to the same degree as identity sprawl with the arrival of AI agents.“Agentic AI systems can perform complex tasks autonomously, but this capability requires expansive access, which introduces complexity and risk.

At this point, it’s almost cliché to say “AI is here, and it is changing everything.” Whether it’s accelerating productivity or reshaping employee workflows, AI is ushering in a new era of operational possibilities. But as we all know, beneath this transformation lies a complex and evolving security challenge.As AI introduces new risks, we’re taking stock of the state of mind of security leaders as they are tackling these new challenges to identify where tangible solutions are most needed. To do this, we commissioned a survey of 200 North American security leaders, which revealed a core tension stemming from AI and the lack of meaningful security controls.Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at 1Password, has been speaking with security leaders around the world and found that there is a shared concern over the deluge of AI tools entering their environments. Lewis said, “My favourite quote was from a CISO in the EU who said to me, ‘We have closed the door to AI tools and projects, but they

SaaS sprawl and shadow IT create significant security vulnerabilities, exposing organizations to unmanaged apps, unauthorized access, and compliance risks. It’s simply not enough to secure access to the applications you’re actively managing. You also need to secure everything else. That’s one of the reasons we acquired 1Password SaaS Manager (formerly Trelica by 1Password) earlier this year.Organizations must be capable of identifying and managing applications that are used outside of IT and security’s purview. We’ve also seen some organizations have a need or desire to incorporate this underlying data from 1Password SaaS Manager into their LLMs and AWS environments, which brings us to today’s announcement.Introducing the MCP Server for 1Password SaaS ManagerThe MCP Server for 1Password SaaS Manager by 1Password provides secure integration between AWS and the Trelica API, enabling deep visibility into SaaS usage, user access, and app activity in Trelica without leaving AWS-native workf

AI agents are rapidly transforming how software is accessed, operated, and integrated, such as automating workflows, calling APIs, and interacting with tools and SaaS platforms on behalf of users. This paradigm unlocks powerful new capabilities, but it also raises urgent questions about how sensitive data, especially credentials and secrets, should be managed.At 1Password, we’re building for this future with security at the center. As we explore protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we are defining clear boundaries. MCP enables AI agents to efficiently interface with APIs, but these data flows often rely on non-deterministic components such as LLMs, whereas authentication requires deterministic, auditable flows. In fact, MCP specifies OAuth 2.1 for authorization, separate from the MCP data protocol interaction with the actual resource servers. Mixing these two modes, secrets and probabilistic inference, violates the model’s integrity and creates unnecessary risk. This is why

While this data appears to be recycled from older breaches, it remains a serious reminder of the persistent risks associated with credential exposure. There&#39;s no need to panic, but here&#39;s why it matters to you:If you reuse passwords or haven&#39;t updated your credentials recently, your accounts could be vulnerable. The good news? There are straightforward actions you can take to protect yourself and your personal information.Before we dive into tips, here’s the TL;DR on the data leak.What Happened? Researchers found 30 separate datasets online, containing approximately 16 billion login credentials. Based on our analysis and discussions within the security community, this appears to be a repackaging of previously compromised data rather than a newly discovered breach.

This blog has been adapted from a section of 1Password’s ebook: Why SSO is not enough for identity security. To read the complete ebook, click here.Single sign-on (SSO) solutions integrate with a company’s identity provider (IdP) to allow users to authenticate to multiple applications via a single log-in. By reducing the number of access points and employee credentials, SSO reduces a company’s attack surface. SSO also makes it easier for IT and security teams to provision and revoke access to applications via the IdP instead of manually managing access for every individual app.SSO grew to prominence in an era of static applications, managed devices, and perimeter-based trust. However, despite SSO’s adoption, companies continue to struggle with untrusted forms of access and an overall widening of the Access-Trust Gap, which SSO cannot stop. For example, SSO solutions can leave many applications and users unsecured.But even when SSO does protect something, questions may remain about how

At RSAC 2025, we announced Extended Device Compliance, a new capability within 1Password Device Trust that enforces device posture Checks before allowing access to web applications, including those not protected by single sign-on (SSO). Extended Device Compliance redefines industry expectations for device trust solutions, ensuring devices are secure and compliant even when users access apps outside traditional admin control.The Access-Trust Gap: Securing unmanaged apps and devicesThe way organizations operate has undergone drastic evolution over the past few years. Employees often work remotely, using a wide range of devices and applications. While security tools like SSO and MDM help secure IT-managed applications and devices, they fall short when users access apps outside this perimeter or use personal devices.

Shadow IT has been a concern of IT and security teams since SaaS became mainstream. However, as SaaS has become increasingly decentralized and employees are more and more tech-savvy, the security issues associated with shadow IT have only become more prevalent. Recent research backs this up.1 in 3 breaches involve shadow IT. (IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report)Through 2027, organizations that fail to centrally manage SaaS life cycles will remain five times more susceptible to a cyber incident or data loss due to incomplete visibility into SaaS usage and configuration.[^1][^1]: (Gartner®, Magic Quadrant™ for SaaS Management Platforms, Tom Cipolla, Yolanda Harris, July 2024.

This blog has been adapted from an excerpted section of 1Password’s ebook: Why SSO is not enough for identity security. To read the complete ebook and learn more about the issues that SSO can’t cover, click here.Sign-on (SSO) solutions are designed to manage and secure access to applications. By integrating with a company’s identity provider (IdP), SSO allows users to authenticate to multiple applications via a single log-in. By reducing the number of access points and employee credentials, SSO reduces a company’s attack surface and makes it easier for IT and security teams to provision and revoke access to applications via the IdP.However, SSO gained prominence in an era of managed devices and simpler security. Today’s employees adopt the latest SaaS and generative AI applications, work from anywhere, use their own devices, and increasingly interact with AI agents.

Passwords remain the most widely used and weakest authentication method in the enterprise. They’re still responsible for the majority of breaches, and IT teams spend an outsized amount of time simply managing them. It’s no wonder that security leaders are shifting toward passwordless authentication, a more secure and phishing-resistant approach that replaces traditional credentials with biometrics, passkeys, and FIDO2-compliant sign-ins.In fact, 60% of breaches involve a human element, such as compromised user credentials or phishing, according to the 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report. And it’s no surprise that 1Password uncovered that 61% of employees admit to having poor password practices, including reusing the same credentials across apps or never changing the IT-selected default password.And while passwordless logins are rapidly gaining attention, getting there isn’t always simple. Many IT and security teams are stuck managing password tickets, managing inconsistent e

Each year on World Password Day, most password managers will remind you that sticky notes are no place for storing passwords, to avoid using “password123,” or to stop repeating passwords across multiple accounts.That is all sound advice, but we’re in 2025. Passwords are still everywhere, but our relationship with them has evolved — or rather, devolved. At this point, it’s common knowledge that passwords are a weak and risky form of authentication, and we should all be working toward a passwordless future. That might sound surprising coming from us, but despite our name, 1Password isn’t a password company. We’re an Extended Access Management company, and we’re seeing things a bit differently this World Password Day.So let’s put the boilerplate password tips aside for now and focus on our ultimate goal: A passwordless future. To be clear, that doesn’t mean a future where we eliminate passwords entirely, but one where we provide the most straightforward and secure sign-in experience for e

SaaS sprawl – the proliferation of applications within an organization, including unsanctioned shadow IT – has created an urgent need for IT and security leaders: keeping sensitive data secure while enabling employees to use the apps they need. That’s why we feel that 1Password SaaS Manager&#39;s inclusion in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for SaaS Management Platforms marks more than just a milestone. It signals the growing need for unified SaaS governance and security.The 2024 report was the first Gartner Magic Quadrant for SaaS Management Platforms (SMPs)[^1]. We believe that including SMPs among other Magic Quadrant[^2] categories signals that they are becoming a critically important tool for managing both security and budgets, especially in the face of the proliferation of SaaS apps and shadow IT.[^1]: Disclaimer: Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the

Admin and developer secrets – such as SSH keys, API keys, and database passwords – are the essential credentials that let developers access the systems they need to do their jobs. If these secrets are compromised, they can grant particularly dangerous levels of unauthorized access, giving bad actors access to an organization’s most sensitive data and mission-critical systems. One compromised SSH key can enable data breaches, service disruptions, and potential full infrastructure compromise.Despite their importance, developer secrets pose a particular challenge to IT and security teams. As Matt Burgess reported for Wired, “It is relatively trivial for a developer to accidentally include their company’s secrets in software or code.” Many breaches, such as the 2022 Uber hack, show how bad actors can then leverage these kinds of hardcoded credentials to escalate their access to company systems, causing severe and costly damage.Given the danger, it’s imperative that IT and security teams ha

In the modern, hybrid workplace, employees have more control than ever over the devices they use for their jobs. In fact, 56% of employees say that they have worked on a personal “bring-your-own” device (BYOD) in the last year. This is despite the fact that 89% of security pros say that their company doesn’t allow BYOD. Clearly, there’s a disconnect between security policies and worker behaviors.It’s not hard to see why employees have embraced BYOD; it’s convenient, and they often feel more productive on their preferred device. But BYOD creates headaches for security and IT leaders, who must ensure that every device that can access corporate data is secure and compliant. Unfortunately, legacy security tools like mobile device management (MDM) solutions, are not sufficient for managing BYOD.Today’s cybersecurity landscape is complex. IT and security professionals need modern solutions with more comprehensive capabilities to govern access to both managed (meaning MDM-enrolled) and unmana

Compliance without access control is incomplete. Security without continuous compliance is inadequate. With 1Password® Extended Access Management and Drata, companies can finally unify these efforts—closing the Access-Trust Gap while accelerating audit readiness, improving security posture, and building trust overall.“Security and compliance are inseparable, especially as SaaS sprawl and AI adoption introduce new layers of complexity and risk,” says David Faugno, Co-CEO of 1Password.Indeed, maintaining cybersecurity compliance has never been easy and has become even more complex in recent years. There’s a vast landscape of global regulations and standards to keep track of, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, and CMMC, to name just a few. Understanding the requirements of these disparate standards is challenging enough, and actually achieving compliance is even more difficult, especially at a time when businesses often lack visibility into how sensitive resources are being accessed.IT and

Whether you know it or not, AI agents are likely being adopted in your organization. And it’s easy to see why. AI agents have the potential to automate and simplify everything from customer service, cybersecurity, IT automation, SaaS workflows, to data processing tasks. If you read that as “the ability to transform the ways we work” — you’re right. AI agents represent nothing less than a sea change to the future of business.While they offer great promise for automating tasks, they pose a unique challenge for security and IT teams. Access from AI agents to internal systems must be secure, monitored, and compliant, and machine-to-machine access must be rethought. There is a real urgency to solving the access management challenges of AI agents. They’re already being adopted in enterprise workflows, autonomously making decisions, triggering tasks, interacting with other applications, and even interacting with customers — often without oversight.

It’s been a year since we announced 1Password Extended Access Management, and in that time, it’s become clearer than ever that we are facing a major shift in how workers use technology to drive productivity. Whether it’s through organizations embracing the use of AI agents or tech-savvy employees independently seeking out any tool or application they need, the way we work has fundamentally evolved. And cybersecurity must evolve with it.With these new dynamics, the ways we’ve traditionally secured access with identity and access management (IAM) or mobile device management (MDM) solutions are not enough. This disconnect between modern requirements and traditional approaches is widening the Access-Trust Gap: the security risks posed by unfederated identities, unmanaged devices, applications, and AI-powered tools accessing company data without proper governance controls.There’s only one way to address identity, device, and app sprawl: by securing every sign-in, to every app, from every de

AI agents are evolving fast — from helpful assistants to autonomous actors that can browse the web, analyze data, resolve customer service issues, assist in generating code, book travel, and more.As these agents take on more responsibilities, it’s crucial that the security model around them keeps up. As we examined in a recent blog post, traditional access controls weren’t built for AI agents that run continuously, span multiple environments, and require expansive permissions to operate.Thus far, developers experimenting with AI agents have inadvertently granted them access to credentials and private context via workarounds, such as disabling MFA or using hardcoded credentials. But this approach is unsafe and unsustainable; there’s a clear and urgent need for secure, time-bound, and auditable access for AI agents.That’s where 1Password Service Accounts and SDKs come in.

BYOD and SaaS adoption have been growing for years, and today, employees expect seamless access to the tools they need – wherever they work, on whatever devices they choose. They’ve taken control of their work environment, selecting applications and devices that best suit their needs, often outside of IT’s visibility.This shift has created a significant security challenge: traditional IAM, IGA, and MDM solutions were built for a controlled, managed environment. But today’s reality is much more complex. Shadow IT and shadow AI are pervasive. Policies that prohibit unsanctioned apps or employee-owned devices are routinely ignored or not enforced.Distinct Problems in Modern Access ManagementAccess management today faces three key challenges:Application Sprawl – A growing number of apps are used without centralized oversight, leading to fragmented access management.Device Sprawl – Employees use personal and unmanaged devices that fall outside traditional IT controls, creating compliance an

To read the complete ebook, click here.For years, global regulations and compliance standards have been a primary driver of Mobile Device Management’s (MDM) adoption in the workplace. This is thanks to its ability to force managed devices, en-masse, into meeting basic levels of compliance.However, MDMs have never been a complete solution for endpoint security or compliance. They’ve only fallen further behind in recent years, which have seen many regulatory standards evolve and require more robust protections for employee endpoints. As such, many security leaders have embraced alternative or complementary solutions to help meet their compliance obligations. Among the most prominent is a category of solutions called device trust.Device trust solutions ensure that devices are both known and in a secure state before they can authenticate to company resources like SaaS apps. While MDM

To read the complete ebook, click here.Security tools inherently introduce some friction into workflows. However, too much friction can impede employee productivity to such a degree that the broader organization suffers. Historically, this has created a dilemma for CISOs, who struggle with finding the right balance between security and productivity.Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions are a classic example of this tension between security, productivity, and user experience. For years, MDMs have been all but ubiquitous in corporate cybersecurity, and they’ve become somewhat infamous for their disruptive approach to enforcing policy. This reputation has led many companies to consider alternative or supplementary solutions for device security.

Passwords, PINs, and codes aren’t just part of your online world. From hotel safes and Wi-Fi passwords to gym lockers and alarm codes, you often need access to data that’s tied to a specific location in the real world (and in the case of alarm codes, you need it in a hurry).Wouldn’t it make life so much easier if you had a simple, quick way to find those items exactly when and where you need them?Well, now you can, thanks to a new capability in the 1Password app. This feature allows you to assign specific locations to items stored in your vaults, which then appear in the 1Password mobile app when you’re near those physical locations.The idea to have 1Password show you location-specific items came to life during one of our Hackathons. The goal: access your items faster wherever and whenever you need them. Even if you don&#39;t know or remember an item&#39;s name, by simply being at the location associated with that item, 1Password would surface that information for youThe resounding positive re

Digital estate planning is like traditional estate planning but focused on everything in your digital life – think passwords, devices, and important documents.1Password founders Sara and Dave Teare joined 1Password Chief Experience Officer Matt Davey on the Random but Memorable podcast to discuss how they approached all aspects of estate planning. The pair share how they’ve made it as simple as possible for their family to carry on with life’s logistics and access their frequently-changing digital assets.Is it a simple process? Predictably, no. But Sara and Dave talk frankly about their experiences with the goal of helping others understand what they should consider with their own estate planning.

This blog has been adapted from a section of 1Password’s ebook: &quot;Why MDM isn’t enough for device security&quot;. To read the complete ebook, click here.For years, mobile device management solutions (MDMs) have been all but ubiquitous in corporate cybersecurity. Devices enrolled in MDM are commonly referred to as “managed,” which reflects the tendency of companies to consider a device functionally secure as long as it has MDM installed.In practice, however, MDMs lack the ability to oversee many critical aspects of device posture and security for enrolled devices. Furthermore, many devices aren’t suitable for enrollment in MDMs, leaving them unmanaged. These unmanaged devices contribute to a widening of the “Access-Trust Gap” across a company’s systems.The Access-Trust Gap refers to the difference between the users, applications, and devices that a business trusts to access sensitive data, and those that can access it in practice. The greater the number of unknown and unmanaged access points,

From fake job postings to fake candidates, it’s clear the job market has changed in the past few years. Finding a job ad that sparks your interest is now only half the battle — the other half is making sure it’s not a scam.I see three or four LinkedIn posts about job searches and applications gone wrong every day. I’ve read tales of recruiter impersonations, postings for roles that don’t exist, and ads that demand money in order to apply. Sometimes these scams even warrant news coverage due to their reach or shock factor.Job market scams certainly aren’t a new concept but they’ve definitely become more sophisticated. Fake LinkedIn profiles are more convincing, phishing tactics have matured, and AI can be used to fake… just about anything — from recruiter’s voices to entire videos.While some recruiting scams are easy to spot, others can fool even the most experienced sleuths.

In December 2024, the FBI and CISA advised Americans against using SMS codes for multi-factor/two-factor (MFA/2FA) authentication. CISA’s Mobile Communications Best Practice Guidance bluntly recommended: “Do not use SMS as a second factor for authentication. SMS messages are not encrypted–a threat actor with access to a telecommunication provider’s network who intercepts these messages can read them.”This guidance came in response to the recent Salt Typhoon cyber espionage attacks, in which bad actors infiltrated multiple telecom companies and accessed call and data logs for an unknown number of victims.However, the advice to transition from SMS-based 2FA to stronger forms of authentication long predates this attack. Security experts said it in 2023, 2020, 2018, and as early as 2016, when NIST issued guidance discouraging the use of SMS as an authenticator.But now, after numerous high-profile MFA bypass attacks, this advice is increasingly urgent, and companies are being forced to reev
